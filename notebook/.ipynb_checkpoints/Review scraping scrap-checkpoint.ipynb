       "<span id=\"freeText9499091634303950684\" style=\"display:none\">The Night Circus is like cake. Cake without frosting. Sure, cake is good, some people will even prefer dry, plain cake all by itself, but others, such as myself, need the sugary sweetness of frosting. Some may prefer the milder whip frosting. Or maybe even caramel or candy to put the final touches on our taste buds. Either way, plain cake, no matter how moist, is not for everyone.<br/><br/>Yes, the writing is beautiful. Beyond beautiful. It's magnificent and breathtaking; the detailed scenery, the magic, the multitude of formidable descriptions of each tent inside this circus is all absolutely stunning. Furthermore, the approach taken to tell the story is excellent. We've got the journey in past and present, walking alongside the characters their whole lives, in addition, we get our very own walk inside this resplendent circus which adds a truly delightful touch to the story. Unfortunately, this is the only aspect of the book I enjoyed: The writing. <br/><br/>While I appreciate more literary books, -- a lot of my favorites are slow paced, extremely well-read books that managed to not only tell me a story, but actually make me live it -- The Night Circus' strongly lethargic plot fails to let it radiate life within its beauty. Filling a book with pizzazz is simply not enough for me. I need a compelling storyline, I need fabulous characters. This is where I was left highly underwhelmed. The \"competition\" we constantly hear of is kept very vague, not really letting us in which only left me confused as to the point of the plot, not to mention let down by the absence of its \"fierceness\" that the blurb promises. Knowing that sometimes all I need is a little patience to eventually get blown away, I kept my hopes up and didn't give up. I was slightly more satisfied at the end, very slightly, though I was expecting much more out of this highly praised novel. If you want to read a book to simply enjoy its outward extravagance, I can see you loving it. However, expect over 500 pages of nothing more. <br/><br/>Strong characters can make a world of difference in books such as this. Characters I would have grown to love, to adore. Characters that would have made an impression on me emotionally. A deep investment in such characters could have made this an instant favorite. Instead what I got were colorless characters with weak personalities that I could not have been less concerned about. Maybe I was distracted by the glamor (catch-22?), maybe it was all the back and forth; whatever the reason, these characters remained characters to me. I never got to <i>know</i> them. I never got to feel their presence, their soul, inside this tale. Where it should have been filled with passion and devotion, sometimes misery, this was only communicated with sentences, not with the actual emotions I was expected to garner. The only character I was mildly interested in was Bailey and his parts, though not insignificant, are far and few. <br/><br/>Your enjoyment of this book will seriously depend on what you're looking for. It's an exquisitely well-written book full of riches and gorgeous descriptions. If this is enough to lure you in and enchant you - I assure you you will be blown away. If an engaging plot and great characterization are also essential for you to have a great reading experience, you won't find it here. Ultimately, you'll either love it, or you won't. <br/><br/>Me, I need my frosting. <br/><br/>--<br/>For more of my reviews, visit my blog at <a href=\"http://www.xpressoreads.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Xpresso Reads</a> <a href=\"http://www.xpressoreads.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">\n",

But would that be proper? <br/><br/>I am of the opinion that, in the case of matter, we can do a little better than that.<br/><br/>So what about: <i>Here, now, as you read this</i>.<br/><br/>I want to tell you a story.<br/><br/>A man in a grey suit uses a silver ring to mark the finger of a little girl who, with half a thought, can break things down and put them back together. As good as new. The mark seals a deal.<br/>A wager.<br/>As that happens, you smell the smell of powder and watch the scene through its reflecton in one of the mirrors that line the walls of the dressing room where the pact is made. The dressing room happens to belong to the most talented illusionist in the world.<br/>A hint:<br/>his are not illusions.<br/><br/>Years pass. (And yet there is no need to call this time anything other than <i>now</i>).<br/><br/>The same fate falls upon a boy. As the ring tightens on his finger, his pain echoes in your hand as well. <br/>It means that the game has begun. <br/><br/>What game? Like chess, but not quite. Maybe, if the chessboard was a circus. Maybe, if a move was a new tent added to it: an Ice Garden, a Carousel, a Labyrinth, a Wishing Tree, a Pool of Tears (whatever it is or does). Someone may say that the circus itself is the game.<br/><br/>And what do <i>you</i> say?<br/><br/>â¢You say that <b>the book itself is the game</b>, and that <b>the book itself is the circus</b>. You say that this three entities, book, circus, game, are one and the same, and thus not severable. You say that you don't know if this count as metafiction, as the ending suggests, but in any case, it bewitches you. <br/><br/>â¢You are <b>overwhelmed</b> by <b>sensations</b>. Your senses are <b>overpowered</b>. Smells, colors (or lack of), touches. Caramel on fresh-made popcorn. Walls of black and white. Imminent rain that stays perched of its coulds and does not fall. The scrape of a pen on a candid sheet of paper. The soft sound of the hand of your clock that goes on, on, on.<br/>You could swim in this world and eat from this table until your eyes are puffy and sore from reading. (Reading, are we sure? That feel so much like life.)<br/><br/>â¢Is it the <b>writing</b>? You are not sure, because it never strikes you as particularly remarkable, or particularly melodic, or particularly anything. It occurs to you that its <b>delicate plainness</b> could be exactly the point of its efficency.<br/><br/>â¢The patrons of this circus are never disappointed, but you, only a bit, are. <br/><i>What's the matter, my child? We will come back tomorrow.</i><br/>You do come back tomorrow. The circus is there no more.<br/>And that is exactly how you feel when you realize that your impression of something being amiss is due to the fact that the <b>romance</b>'s pace is not right. They pass from interest (strong, yes, but still apparently nothing more than interest) to deep, mad love. And moreover, the fall should be like a dance, or like, indeed, a game of chess: <b>moves and counter moves</b>. And that's how it is, and it's enchanting, but it also feels <b>unidirectional</b>. <a class=\"jsShowSpoiler spoilerAction\">(view spoiler)</a><span class=\"spoilerContainer\" style=\"display: none\">[Celia and Marco rarely appear on the stage together. You see the competition between them, you see that it is real. But while Celia works with the circus and therefore lives surrounded by Marco's creations, Marco doesn't. It is understanble that Celia falls in love with the conceiver of the attractions so dear to her, but what about him? He doesn't know her.  <a class=\"jsHideSpoiler spoilerAction\">(hide spoiler)</a>]</span><br/>You try to shake off yourself the <b>awkward feeling</b> of such an <b>unbalanced relationship</b>. You can't.<br/><br/>â¢While you accept that the mystery is a big part of the charm of the story, you can't help wishing things were explained more properly, especially concerning the<b> ending</b>. Because the ending doesn not satiate you, if anything, leaves you thirstier than before, <b>leaves you with the convinction that your copy must be missing some pages</b>. It's <i>not </i>a sensation you enjoy right after finishing a standalone.<br/><br/>And now you have seen the contents of all the tents, seen all the attractions, tasted all the treats the circus can offer. You watch the clock: unbelievably late. But you don't want to leave yet. You turn around to look for something else to see.<br/>You find the circus has disappeared, unconcerned with your presence within its former borders.<br/>You wonder if it was ever there to begin with.<br/>You turn the page and read the word <i>End</i>, and you know it's just a figure of speech.</span>\n",

I loved the lyrical language, the mystical, beautiful imagery, and the slow-building romance, with just enough of an edge to the story to make it really interesting.<blockquote>When the battles are fought and won and lost, when the pirates find their treasures and the dragons eat their foes for breakfast with a nice cup of Lapsang souchong, someone needs to tell their bits of overlapping narrative. There's magic in that. It's in the listener, and for each and every ear it will be different, and it will affect them in ways they can never predict.</blockquote></span>\n",

How it got there so suddenly, hoisted without any noise or being seen, and most unusual, no publicity ... it's a circus. But not like anything, anyone has ever gazed at, the sign says performances commence, only when the sun sets, unheard of, the money they will lose. Le Cirque des Reves , ( The Circus of Dreams), has many tents of different sizes and heights, yet no main one, customers roam around and choose their own pleasures, unfeasible, for just one day's viewing, the preferences you can imagine, vary widely, some attractions are outside the canvases, on the ground. Nevertheless people are intrigued, they flock in long lines, to see the newest novelty, with a large wondrous clock, at its entrance, to conquer their boredom. In the domes, are the usual, death defying acrobats, without a net, wise fortune tellers, no animals, though, a contortionist, who's body does painful looking flexing and bending, almost grotesque, an illusionist, Celia Bowen, who seems as if she has real magical powers, that amaze , but that is impossible, right? A murky, cloud maze, where customers climb high above the earth, trying to find a way out, without falling, snow, and ice, too, countless mirrors showing strange images, weird birds that look genuine, flying around the tents, lights that can not actually exist, sounds and objects from who knows where? There is an unworldly aspect about this place, that people feel, but will not acknowledge, after all, it is just an ordinary circus. Naturally followers quickly develop,\"Reveurs\", who perpetually go from city to city, after the unique carnival, always searching and communicating with their fellow travelers, wearing black and white clothes, with red scarves, asking constantly, where is the Night Circus? They need the excitement, the fantasy, the delight , and get away from their dull, empty lives. Still the the main story is Celia and Marco, two rivals, in an endless, deadly, wizardry game, that the loser will not survive this contest, arranged by her father Prospero the Enchanter, (Hector Bowen), a gifted magician, maybe too much so, and Alexander, ( not his real name), \" The Man in the Grey Suit\", who raised the orphan, called now, Marco Alisdair. These selfish men with supernatural abilities, pit their children against each other, for their sick amusement. But the attractive rivals start to like each other, (love is in the air), against everything they were taught... Still one must perish ... A fairy tale for grownups, with enough magic, romance , mystery and tragedy, to satisfy every person interested in great entertainment, ultimately, the unknown is always fun to read about, from the safety of our homes ...</span>\n",

The major storyline pits two young magicians (and two schools of thought) in a mysterious battle set in a traveling night circus. The circus is both the main and most interesting character. The secondary story line involves a young boy in Massachusetts who visits the circus and returns as a young man. The tertiary story line involves you, the reader, walking through the circus in the present day. <br/><br/>The structure of the book mimics the circus where it's set: short, captivating chapters, each a feat to take your breath away. As you read from one to the next, the marvels pile up, the plot lines converge, and you're left wondering how the whole thing was even possible.<br/><br/>There's also the sensory overload of fantastical, wildly original sights that defy physics, sweet and savory smells drifting across chapters, and the kind of perfectly delicious foods that only exists in the imagination. It left me as happily dizzied and awe-struck as a <i>reveur</i>.<br/><br/>A few of my favorite things about the novel: Widget and Poppet (nicknames) are twins born in the circus. Widget's story to his sister of a wizard and a tree might be the best bedtime story I've ever read. Also, I love how Morgenstern ends so many chapters, not with a cliff hanger to get you reading on, but with a dramatic flourish that'll lead you to reflect on what's already happened.<br/><br/>Caveats: The plot takes a little while to rev up, but this is fine considering the beautiful writing that sets the stage. There are a number of plot lines mentioned only in hints and rumors, and Morgenstern relies on these to add depth. I enjoyed that, but some people might not. <br/><br/>All in all, this is a wonderful book I feel comfortable recommending to anyone, regardless of their reading tastes. Five stars.</span>\n",

Ten days ago I could ask myself several questions and walk away quite sober. <br/><br/>Questions like...<br/><br/>Never have I ever stalked on author two chapters into reading their book.<br/><br/>Never have I ever created a Pinterest board...for another author's book.<br/><br/>Never have I ever ordered the special edition signed hardcopy for three easy payments of just $38 before I've even finished the eBook.<br/><br/>Never have I ever decided to get a tattoo that's \"just so totally me\" after reading another author's book. <br/><br/>Never have I ever wanted to redecorate my house to submerge myself in another author's world.<br/><br/>Suffice it to say, I'm quite drunk now. I've read hundreds of books, and never have I ever felt, after finishing one, that my view of the world is just a little bit prettier because of it. <br/><br/>Until this one. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. I've read some great books that made me happy, and taken things away from them, loved them, and wanted to reread them. I've adored characters, settings, the authors' writing, but it's not often I want to live inside the story. It's not often that I really, really, really want it to be real. <br/><br/>The Night Circus was more than just a story. It was an experience for me, and anyone reading it should remember that you're not getting a quick, easy instant gratification read. You're getting a dream. <br/><br/>Morgenstern takes you into the circus, makes you a part of it with a handful of sporadically placed 2nd person point-of-view scenes, and colors the pictures for you. How everything looks, smells, tastes, feels, and sounds, and you find yourself wondering about the mysterious life of these performers. <br/><br/>So the circus merely appears. Who's setting it up? What does everyone do when the circus is not open? Do they even exist? Are they vulnerable to death, sickness, or outside influence? What happens if Celia or Marco just stop their battle? What's the prize for winning? <br/><br/>Most often while reading a book, I'll flip to the last page if I start to feel nervous about the ending. Or I'll go on Amazon and read reviews to connect, in some way, with other readers who've read it. With this book, though, I couldn't bring myself to do either. I wanted to love it, and I didn't want anyone else giving me reasons not to finish. The story was expertly planned, beautifully written, and Morgenstern's hard work deserved my solid effort to resist the temptation of looking for spoilers. So I held back. And I was not disappointed. I'm glad I experienced the book unspoiled. <br/><br/>Several times during reading I had to remind myself that this was not a romance. I kept getting aggravated that the hero and heroine weren't in many scenes together at first, until I remembered that while there is a romance in it, the novel is primarily a fantasy. So be patient. The circus needs to be set up, the players put into place, and the slow burn is well worth the wait. Seeing Celia and Marco dance around each other was wonderfully agonizing. <br/><br/>And those of you apprehensive about historicals, rest assured this book doesn't focus on details of the era so much. It's simply the backdrop. <br/><br/>So yes, I loved it. <br/><br/>I loved how the author kept revealing secrets to the end, I love that she gave us a worthy ending, I love that this made me want to be a better writer, and I really need the movie. This is exactly the type of story that should be seen put to life, whether or not it truly does the story justice. I still want to see it. <br/><br/>Hey, I'd even dress up for premiere night. Maybe with a red scarf and bowler hat. I don't know. Maybe.<br/><br/>Aw, who am I kidding? I'm going to wear a red scarf and bowler hat tomorrow. ;) <br/><br/></span>\n",

While this could have turned into a huge fracas, it actually proceeds sedately and professionally as each child makes a career as illusionists performing real magic, until one day they discover each other.<br/><br/>I'll be honest. I didn't really care for the book all that much until it became a romance. Odd, no? Well, that's where it took off for me, and I held on with great fear. :) The rest was great fun.<br/><br/>Second to that, however, was the tone and the atmosphere. I understood a great love for the circus, with all the great care and tending it required, how the magic was bound to it and how things could be utterly messed up without that underlying spark. It was rather sweet and dreamy.</span>\n",

       "</p> <br/><br/>This is quite an unique book and story. The cover is captivating, that is for sure. The story itself is very original and beautifully written. It started with an intriguing ambience, a magician, known as Prospero, discovering a daugther he never thought he had, who in fact has special abilities as himself. I would even say she is even more talented. The man in question decided to embark his daughter, Celia, in a long and mysterious competiton of which very few people know about. Her opponent will be chosen by one of Prospero's powerful acquaintances. <br/><br/>The reason I decided to read this popular novel is simple. I love competitions. As I said in my review of <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17565845.Panic\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Panic by Lauren Oliver\">Panic</a>, I love the feeling of excitement and being able to choose 'my' winner and hoping he/she will be the one who will succeed until the end. In this book, it was a bit disappointing because the competition itself is but isn't at the same time the main attraction. Not many people know about it, so it is mainly a secret the two participants are keeping. They're actually trying to understand themselves what it is actually about. The synopsis is misleading us to think that it will exciting and mysterious and maybe fun, but it isn't quite like that. It sure is mysterious but than mostly annoying because you want to learn why the two men started it and what happens and when but it is very vague.<br/><br/>The characters are interesting. A huge problem I had is that, at the beginning, I thought Celia was in fact Isobel all the time she was hanging with Marco. It changed my way of seeing those characters and I only discovered they were not after about half of the book. I would like to say it is my only fault but I can't because it truly was confusing. When Isobel first met Marco, she was shy and had a passion for magic, of course, but so was Celia. And they both had similar if not the same age. I'd like to warn you so you won't make the same mistake: Celia and Isobel are two different person.<br/><br/>My favorite character at the beginning was Celia because she was a bit of a rebel but Bailey fastly took her place. His admiration for Le Cirque des RÃªves was adorable and interesting. I always wanted to know what would happen this time when he goes to the circus. It mostly was through him that we witnessed shows and breathtaking illusions. It is impossible to not like his calmness and charming nature. <br/><br/>The romance wasn't rushed but it felt to me like it was a bit, even if there was some leap of time before the characters grew fond on each other. Marco and Isobel were bonded to each other since a young age, so I guess I can understand it. I obviously didn't predict it because I thought Celia was Isobel so that she already met Marco before and was just afraid to tell him that. Well...that's not what happened of course. After all, at least it wasn't cheesy as I thought so that made it quite enjoyable.<br/><br/><img alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" height=\"340\" src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1403981057i/10174206._SY540_.jpg\" width=\"400\"/><br/><br/>Overall, I thought this was an interesting, well-written and especially different read with unique characters. It has an alternative POV and the chapters are actually back-and-forth in time ones. It didn't bother me because it made me always wonder what will the next chapter contain.

The imagery of the circus is incredible. <br/><br/>Words that do not describe this book: progressive, structured, plot-based.<br/><br/>As charming as the characters are (the Murray twins in particular), I was more worried about the fate of the circus than about what happened to Marco or Celia or anyone else. I honestly wasn't that interested in the story. I didn't get that ending but wasn't invested enough to be particularly worried about it. <br/><br/>It's very thought-provoking and (purposefully?) metaphorical. It's also very lovely but feels more like a character study (the character being the circus, of course, and by extension life itself??) than a complete novel. I understand the adoration of many readers and I truly enjoyed it even if I didn't love it.<br/><br/>Jim Dale gives a typically fantastic audiobook performance.</span>\n",

Itâs the other way around, usually; the summary doesnât do the actual story justice, or it might not even reveal that much. Not with this book. When it first hit bookstores, publishers marketed <i>The Night Circus</i> as âthe next <i>Harry Potter</i>,â which, every time I recall this con, makes me want to tear my pretty hardback copy into tiny pieces and light them on fire. <i>The Night Circus</i> promises an electrifying romance between dueling illusionists, Celia and Marco, who are fighting to the death: âUnbeknownst to the players, this is a game in which only one can be left standing, and the circus is but the stage for a remarkable battle of imagination and will.â Well, as it turns out, the âduelâ is not a battle at all; it is a series of illusions--at the circus--that each creates to impress the other over the course of more than ten years. Thereâs no rush to conclude this âduel,â apparently. That lack of urgency makes for a very yawn-inducing story, particularly at the storyâs halfway point. <br/><br/>I was most looking forward to getting to this part of the story: â...they innocently tumble head-first into love. A deep, passionate, and magical love that makes the lights flicker and the room grow warm whenever they so much as brush hands.â I was sorely disappointed. Celia and Marco <i>somehow</i> fall in love; Morgenstern never showed the development of their love. For their first few interactions, Celia plays it cool with Marco; then the moment she doesn't play it cool is the moment Cupid hits his mark. They touch hands at one point, and something happens with the lights. That happens twice in the entire 387 pages, if that. Given how this light-flickering made it into the summary, however, youâd think these two were causing regular brownouts; furthermore, thereâs nothing deep or passionate about this coupleâs love. The lone sex scene in the book is a literal bodice-ripper, and itâs clichÃ©d and dispassionate. Morgenstern tried her damnedest, but there's zero heat between these two, no matter how warm they make the room simply by brushing hands. <br/><br/><i>The Night Circus</i> contains an extensive cast of characters who are more mysterious than they have any right to be and are very shallowly drawn. Who is Prospero, really? Who is Mr. A.H., really? Here are two intriguing characters portrayed as having possible psychopathic tendencies, yet they are nothing but shadows in the story. Marco is impossible to like at times, which I question was Morgenstern's intention. Celia is almost more noteworthy for her gowns than for her personality. Isobel is a pining, ignored, sad sack character who wastes time searching for answers in tarot cards. The list goes on. Each character can be perfectly, thoroughly summarized in a single sentence. <br/><br/>The descriptions are excessive to the point of being purple, slowing the storyâs momentum each and every time. Morgenstern paid extreme attention to writing detail at the expense of writing a solid, organized plot that clips along at a steady pace. Pretty, unique descriptions do not a story make; the all-important plot and three-dimensional character development must be in place before anything else. Focusing on descriptions while sacrificing plot and character development is like buying an entire houseâs worth of furniture when you have no house to put it in. <br/><br/>I think one of the best pieces of writing advice Iâve ever read after âshow, don't tell,â is William Faulknerâs instruction to âkill your darlings.â If Morgenstern had killed her darlings, <i>The Night Circus</i> would be shorter by at least one-third and possibly, hopefully, have a tighter plot while being a little more fun to readâalbeit with the same one-dimensional, unknowable characters.<br/><br/>Final verdict: Skip without reservation and read the <i>Harry Potter</i> series instead for true magic in book form.</span>\n",

It was the first book I read that made me realize how much I missed reading since I was a child. It will always hold a very special place in my heart. <br/><br/>That being said... <b>I want to be honest about what to expect if you're considering reading this book.</b> I think the description can be a bit deceiving. While the story is breathtakingly beautiful, it is quite slow moving. It is rich in detail and every chapter feels like a work of art. <b>The description makes it feel like this will be a fast paced and intense duel-to-the-death plot... but please be warned that this is not the case. The duel between the two magicians is very abstract and spans the course of several years. This story is meant to be savored, preferably with a serving of chocolate.</b><br/><br/>I still can't help but adore this book to pieces. It is told from multiple POVs and even different times. You'll be following your POV <b>(yes... <u>you</u> are a character in this book and no, I'm not joking and it is super cool..)</b> alongside of the past and the future. Don't let it scare you- I don't think its too confusing.. and everything is building up towards the end. <br/><br/>I can't rave enough about the characters. Celia and Marco (the two magicians who inevitably fall in love) have such an interesting dynamic. Their chemistry and curiosity for each other is off the charts. I enjoyed every scene with them together (and oh my word.. the scene where Celia leaves her shaw... helloooo goosebumps.) <br/><br/><blockquote>\n",

Widget and Poppet are the most adorbs characters ever. Their story (along with Bailey's) is really neat as it plays out. Not to mention- they are hysterical! <br/><br/>And the world? Completely stunning and artistic - with a dash of steampunk awesomeness. <br/><br/>All in all, I highly recommend this to anyone with a love for magicians, mystery, romance, historical fiction, and timepieces. I should also note that I listened to the audiobook which is narrated by Jim Dale (the same narrator from Harry Potter) - and I HIGHLY recommend it. <br/><br/><a href=\"http://www.herbookishthings.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">My Blog</a> ~ <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/herbookishthings/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Instagram</a></span>\n",

Everyone and every review (okay maybe not every,) but the majority say that this is the best book in forever. I might be in the unpopular opinion here, but I would have wanted someone to tell me that the book's official summary is misleading. I was lead to believe that this was going to be non-stop action book, by this statement: \"...a fierce competition is under way-- a dual between two young magicians...\" And... It's not. <br/><br/><b>WHY I READ IT:</b> I was able to win an ARC copy (one that I was extremely excited about), it has more five star reviews than not, rave reviews, and it has a confirmed film deal. (Maybe I shouldn't have know that there was a film deal, because I kept thinking that there was no way for this to be seen on film, and I think w/ the lack of action, it might make people fall asleep.) Overall, the book left me with shrugged shoulders. I wouldn't say I regretted reading it, but I wouldn't necessarily say it was enjoyable either. <br/><br/><b>WHAT I LIKED:</b> I like the circus setting, the \"magic\", and at points I was rushing through the pages to see what was happening next. The imagery and details of the circus were beautiful, but there were somethings I just could not visualize. Maybe that's the point? <br/><br/><b> WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: </b> The book has time jumps that at first make things very confusing. It also introduces many characters at once. I found myself flipping back to see who they were and in what year I was reading. I understand it's done to hold the reader's interest, but it is mostly distracting. It makes the reader feel distant from the characters, at least that's what it did for me. The characters they introduce are of importance, but I'd rather the story not focus on certain characters to give me more of the characters that mattered to me the most: Celia, Marco, Bailey, Poppet and Widget. Although I cared for these characters, I really felt like I didn't connect as much as I'd like to have or I should have. Also, I like reading books with a great romance aspect, and it was being hyped as this super romantic book, so maybe that was the downfall? I thought this romance would be of EPIC proportions. It was sweet, but it is easily forgettable...just like the entire story. Sorry, I just don't get how this is a five-star book--at all.<br/></span>\n",

       "<span id=\"freeText1105941808092116645\" style=\"display:none\">(<b>Actual Rating:</b> 3.5 stars)<br/><br/><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4370565.Erin_Morgenstern\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Erin Morgenstern\">Erin Morgenstern</a>'s debut novel, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9361589.The_Night_Circus\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern\">The Night Circus</a>, is a book bound to divide book lovers into the \"loved it\" and \"hated it\" categories. Some people will adore the prose; others will despise it for being flowery and excessive. Some readers will hate the false promises the blurb on the jacket copy offers; others will still find something magical to love and admire in this novel despite the deception within the blurb. As for me, I was divided in my opinions. I mean, I <i>really, really</i> wanted that story the blurb promised about a \"fierce competition\" and \"a deep, passionate, and magical love.\" I still want someone to write it since, sadly, Morgenstern didn't give it to me.<br/><br/>What Morgenstern did give me, however, was a lovely novel about the passage of time surrounding a circus concocted by magical means. The circus here is not just a location: it too is a character, one that is more vibrant than many of the other characters within this story. Morgenstern succeeds at making the magic wondrous and enchanting, although those looking for the rules to the enchantments will come away disappointed. There is no rhyme or reason to the magic here: it simply <i>is</i>, and that is as much a strength as it is a deficit.<br/><br/>The novel has no consistent timeline or narrative either, given that the chapters alternate among the past and present, standalone moments from the circus itself, and character viewpoints of varying importance. Although <i>The Night Circus</i> contains literary merit, it doesn't have quite enough <i>spark</i> to achieve everything all its build-up promised.<br/><br/>Le Cirque des RÃªves (The Circus of Dreams) has an uncommon inception within London in 1873: two gentlemen, one who calls himself Prospero and the other who dons a grey suit and is known as Alexander, make a wager that two pupils of theirs will undergo a magical competition. Prospero's choice is his daughter, Celia, whom he has only been aware of for the past six months. Alexander, however, does not make his choice until the following January: an orphaned boy whose name Alexander does not care to know. These two children become bound together by a magical pact, but they remain unaware of each other for many years. Only once the magical circus, the chosen venue for the competition, is in its planning stages does the real game begin...<br/><br/>\"Competition\" doesn't quite fit what transpires within the circus because of the magic of Celia and Marco (the orphaned boy). There are no showdowns, no competitive scenes, no dangerous moments. Instead, the novel showcases how Celia and Marco try to one-up each other with how enchanting their various contributions to the circus can be. These enchantments, however, devolve into almost a flirtation between the two as they silently create new tents and exhibits for the sole purpose of impressing one another. It's a nice idea, but it would have born more weight if <b>both sides had been aware of each other's identities sooner in the novel</b>. Somehow, we're meant to believe that, with so much secrecy abounding, these two can honestly, truly fall in love. And that is one of the greatest flaws within <i>The Night Circus</i>: the love story is not deep, passionate, dangerous, or even really sensical, and it makes the story weaker than it otherwise might have been.<br/><br/>The first meaningful conversation between Celia and Marco occurs <b>halfway through the book</b>. Then, Morgenstern does the unthinkable: the next chapter is set <b>three years later</b>, and suddenly Marco is proclaiming, \"I'm in love with her.\" Really? <i>Really?</i> There needed to be <i>some</i> transition between the two chapters, something to bridge the gap to show that something was growing in the hearts of these two individuals now that they were both aware of one another. Instead, the love between the two is shoddy and gimmicky, the stuff of an hour-and-a-half movie rather than a nearly 400-page novel with a literary bent.<br/><br/>Now, you must be wondering: <i>\"Jillian, if you had such a problem with the love story, why give the novel three-and-a-half stars?\"</i> Because the novel isn't <i>just</i> the love story. There was plenty more for me to like in this novel: the segments about the circus's various attractions, a plot line following a boy named Bailey who's in love with the circus, and the inclusion of <i>rÃªveurs</i> (dreamers) who follow the circus around the world. Basically, <i>the circus is the main character</i>...and, given what I read about it, I knew that if such a place existed I would probably be in love with it too. So I couldn't dislike the novel simply because the story introduced me to such an intriguing, enchanting place.<br/><br/>All my qualms and opinions aside, <i>The Night Circus</i> is a charming story, but it won't be for everyone simply because it's not as universal as it could have been. It may be a literary smash-hit for a time, but will it be a classic read in the decades to come? I doubt it. However, if Erin Morgenstern can hone her craft a bit more, then maybe someday she really will become a household name. For now, though, <i>The Night Circus</i> is the debut novel that will either enchant or alienate readers. Whether you will be one or the other, that all depends on how you fare with the circus and its offerings if you give this novel a go.</span>\n",

To let you keep me from breaking chandeliers rather than constantly worrying about it myself.\"<br/><br/>This story was spectacular! Although it took me an immensely long time to read, I really wanted to be able to take everything in and understand how each different story line connected. It is an incredibly detailed and descriptive novel, which I understand can definitely hinder the experience for certain readers. This was not the case with me as I live for description. I love being able to visualize so clearly that the novel is almost like a movie playing in my mind. The atmosphere was also incredible. I truly wish I could go to a circus like this, and experience everything that there is within this magical place. Erin Morgenstern really put so much effort and love into creating every detail, whether it be of The Night Circus itself, or the characters. <br/><br/>Speaking of which, the characters are what made this book for me. They were phenomenal. Every single character was so rich, and well developed. Although these characters were magical and were out of the ordinary, they were still flawed, which makes them much more realistic, and allows the reader to understand the thought process behind certain decisions. Celia Bowen was so delicately crafted, and was an absolute treat to read about. She had a temper like no other, but used it to power herself and create her illusions rather than let it ruin her. She understood consequences and was very smart in her own ways, and never once made a decision where I thought 'oh no, here we go', which in my books is definitely a plus. She was so intricate and well developed, to the point of seeing her within myself. Marco Alisdair was incredible to read about as well. He was charming, and effortless, and so incredibly fascinating. He never pretended to be more than he was, and acted as though he much more ordinary than one would assume. I really connected with him for reasons I can't overly explain, most likely for his flawed nature, making him seem real. His tension with Celia was unbearable, and they truly do belong together. I think my personal favourite characters were the Murray twins, Poppet and Widget. They brought the book to life for me, with their talents, their descriptions, and especially their stories, which come to play towards the end. Even being so incredibly young throughout the novel, the oldest being sixteen, they are still so incredibly developed, and their decisions and thoughts, while also being flawed, are understandable. Their youth made the story more lighthearted, which was an added bonus. Included with them is Bailey, who was a wonderful addition, and an amazing twist. He is the epitome of every child/teenager who doesn't know what to do, but given the options, none appeal to them. I loved his parts in the story, and appreciated his struggles. I can't forget about Tsukiko, who spewed some of the greatest lines I've ever read in a book, and had such immense strength that inspires you, and makes you understand that strength is really found within. Herr Friedrick Thiessen, whose love for the circus was incomprehensible, and contrasted immensely with the other forms of love throughout the story. There were the supposed villains, and I say supposed because they are not really villains, but people with a flawed view on reality due to the fact that they themselves do not understand it the way mere mortals might. To not give away spoilers, I will not mention who, or why this is. <br/><br/>As this story is mostly character driven, the plot is quite a bit slower but I do not think that this takes away from the novel whatsoever. This allows the reader to be able to immerse themselves within the story and understand each and every chapter and how they all connect in the end. I did take away half a star simply because this was quite hard to understand and grasp at certain points, and some pages or chapters I had to reread to simply get an idea of what was going on. I really did love this book overall and highly recommend it to anyone who is trying to delve into adult fantasy, as that was the case with me. I think the story will capture your attention, and the wonderful descriptions will only carry you forward. I will definitely be giving this a reread in the near future, as there are still a few things that I think I may have missed. I connected with the story and the characters, and for me that is always a priority. Overall, a fantastically flawed novel that everyone should read. 4.5/5 stars! </span>\n",

I know in my review I initially gave it a 4 stars because of the lack lustre ending, the poor world building and the illogical plot points but the journey The Night Circus took me on was so intriguing and beautiful that all this didn't really matter to me at all. <br/><br/>On a 2nd read, The Night Circus really comes to life as it shines like a beacon in the night sky. There's so much detail that I got to appreciate on my 2nd read, it was as if I had taken an entirely different journey all together. This is why I have decided to award this book a 5 stars despite all it's flaws.<br/><br/>Sometimes it is always about the journey and not the destination. </i><br/><br/><b>The finest of pleasures are always the unexpected ones</b><br/><br/>The Night Circus is going to be one of those books you'd either get sucked into and get totally engrossed or the kinda that gets you scratching your head and thinking 'ok can we please get on with the plot?'. Why? Cause the nonlinear storyline is definitely unique and will give an experience that you either care for or you don't. The narration jumps in between 3 timelines - the current, the not so distant future and also another that takes place in some unknown timeline. It also changes POVs throughout the timelines giving you a rich experience to see the story unfold from different character's eyes. There's even a '2nd person' POV (that's the one with the unknown timeline) that let's you experience the circus first hand! <br/><br/>You can almost think of it like little stories that are seemingly isolated in nature but held together by a single string. It's really almost like Pulp Fiction but think Victorian, oh and with Magic, oh and minus John Travolta and Uma Thurman. A more closer analogy would be to compare it to <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2623.Great_Expectations\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Great Expectations by Charles Dickens\">Great Expectations</a> where you're not quite sure how everything fits together until the last couple of chapters. <br/><br/>At times, certain stories seem out of place because you're not quite sure how they fit into the bigger picture while some sections just flow seamlessly. Speaking of the bigger picture, as a reader you'd get a bit lost at times because you won't see the bigger picture till the 85% mark of the book. So this ends up making the plot excruciatingly slow (the duel mentioned in the synopsis is not a quick one but one that spans over many decades!). As you can see for some, this could be a frustrating experience.<br/><br/>So why on earth would you continue reading stories that don't seem to fit in place of a plot? The writing is really the answer (well it was for me). The writing of The Night Circus is richly imaginative with beautiful narration that just leaps off the page like rich poetry. Despite being written in 3rd person and even 2nd person, it is very introspective yet descriptive with an almost lyrical magical quality to it.<br/><br/><i>Everything in this tent is white. Nothing black, not even stripes visible on the walls. A shimmering, almost blinding white. There are trees and flowers and grass surrounding twisted pebble pathways, every leaf and petal perfectly white.</i><br/><br/><i>Secrets have power. And that power diminishes when they are shared, so they are best kept and kept well. Sharing secrets, real secrets, important ones, with even one other person, will change them. Writing them down is worse, because who can tell how many eyes might see them inscribed on paper, no matter how careful you might be with it. So it's really best to keep your secrets when you have them, for their own good, as well as yours.<br/></i><br/><br/>However if you strip away the beautiful narration and the nonlinear experience, the story itself is kinda drab and at times it doesn't make any sense (i.e. how you win the duel is so ambiguous, seriously what's stopping the magicians from working together to thy kingdom come so that nobody has to die?!). The plot is like the younger less tedious cousin of <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com:443/search/search?q=Jonathan Strange and Mr Norell\" title=\"Jonathan Strange and Mr Norell\">Jonathan Strange and Mr Norell</a> however I do think that the Jonathan Strange is better thought thru and the world building there is almost flawless. There's also the issue with character motivations, some character motivations didn't make any sense at all (why on earth would you do that was my constant question). <br/><br/>Surprisingly, the world building also doesn't hold up to tight scrutiny either. For example, if you were to ask me what sort of magic they do I couldn't tell you because the laws of magic in their world wasn't even explained properly. The nature of their duel too is also shrouded in mystery and the rules to win it even more so. <br/><br/>The more important question of them all is, does it all pay off in the end like it did in Pulp Fiction and even Great Expectations? Honestly? I don't think so. I thought the ending was kind of weak (almost a deus ex machina) with a lot of things not explained well or not even addressed at all! It's such a waste that all the elements didn't come together as nicely as it could which is why I had rated this book a 4 star instead of a 5. Then again I've been told that this book demands a re-reading and that it may change my perception of the ending. But for now, with just a one read through my view that the ending was lacklustre still stands. <br/><br/>Despite all its flaws, The Night Circus is a very unique and special book somehow weaving itself into my heart and never letting go. I definitely enjoyed the journey that The Night Circus has brought me along but was disappointed when I arrived at my destination. But you know, sometimes it really is about the journey and not about the destination after all. <br/></span>\n",

       "<span id=\"freeText6452775119245004169\" style=\"display:none\">I can understand why people <i>like</i> this book, but I have a hard time seeing why people <i>love</i> it so much. Maybe the hype monster just killed it for me; though, I did wait over a year and a half since getting it to finally read it. But since I know so many people who rave about this one, I figured there was no way that Iâd dislike it. And itâs not that I hated this book by any meansâitâs incredibly inventive and lush and unique, and I appreciated thatâbut I definitely didnât find myself falling head over heels for it.<br/><br/>My issue with this book is probably what other people do enjoy so much about it: it is incredibly descriptive. For me, itâs almost <i>too</i> descriptive. Itâs about twice as long as it had to be to tell the same story. The author spends pages and pages at times just describing the surroundings of the circus, and after a while it becomes repetitive and dull. I was desensitized to the descriptions after reading about the smells and sights and general goings-on for so much of the story. But to some people that might be incredibly delightful and enjoyable to read about. I felt that it distracted from the storyline too much.<br/><br/>So sure, atmospherically this book is definitely a 4 or 5-star book. But when you are being told to care about these characters, especially the duel between Celia and Marco and their eventual romance (no, this isnât a spoiler; itâs all in the description on the back of the book), I just couldnât get myself to care all that much. I did, however, really like Bailey, Poppet, and Widget. All of their chapters together were wonderful, and truth be told I wouldâve rather just read a book about them. I think the twins had such a unique story that they could warrant a book all about themselves.<br/><br/>If I hadnât listened to the audiobookânarrated by the fabulous Jim Daleâalongside reading it, I probably wouldâve given up about halfway through. For a 512 page book, absolutely nothing that seems remotely exciting or important happens until page 328 (that is specific because I remember on that page thinking, âFinally! Something thrilling!â). Thatâs 64% of the way through! Eek.<br/><br/>But 3 stars isnât bad. Iâd probably give it a 2.5 if Goodreads allowed half stars, but 2 just seems too low compared with other 2 star books Iâve read lately. There were moments I was completely transported by the book, but then Iâd find myself bored and coming back to reality. I donât know who I would recommend this book to because if you are expecting an exciting magic duel at a thrilling night circus, you wonât be getting that. Know that youâll be reading much more about the characters, their set-up, and the circusâs description until you reach a rather anticlimactic ending. <br/></span>\n",

       "<span id=\"freeText6360409785058113163\" style=\"display:none\">4 Stars!<br/><br/>\" The circus arrives without warning. No announcements precede it, no paper notices plastered on lampposts and billboards. It is simply there, when yesterday it was not.<br/>Within these nocturnal black-and-white-striped tents awaits an utterly unique experience, a feast for the senses, where one can get lost in a maze of clouds, meander through a lush garden made of ice, stare in wonderment as the tattooed contortionist folds herself into a small glass box, and become deliciously tipsy from the scents of caramel and cinnamon that waft through the air. <br/>Welcome to Le Cirque Des Reves. \"<br/><br/>What a great book to end 2015 with and with only 45 minutes to go! The writing was so beautiful and descriptive, to the point that I could picture every aspect of the circus mentioned, I could smell the scents described. And just wow. I wish this circus was real and that I could go spend an evening exploring it.<br/><br/>The circus, while the real star of the story, is merely a venue for a fierce competition between two young illusionists, Celia and Marco. They have been trained since childhood to compete in a \" game \" to which they have been irrevocably bound. Unbeknownst to them, only one can be left standing at the end of this game. The circus is merely a stage for a battle of imagination, strength and will. <br/><br/>When Celia discovers that Marco is her adversary, they begin to think of the game as a collaboration rather than a competition. They don't yet know how the game must end and they fall in love. This unforeseen occurence forces their masters to intervene with dangerous consequences, not just for Celia and Marco, but for everyone involved in the circus, from the performers to the patrons.<br/><br/>This story is very unique. I've never read anything quite like it. It starts out a bit slow, but the writing style just sucks you right in from the beginning. It is told in alternating times and from alternating POV's, with everything coming together towards the end. I think it all flowed together really well, it was never confusing for me. I grew to really like a lot of the side characters, especially Poppet and Widget ( red haired twins born backstage on the opening night of the circus, who appear more and more throughout the story ).<br/><br/>I think the only thing I didn't care for was the insta-love between Marco and Celia. It seemed too sudden for me to be fully on board with it. But overall, I really liked this and am hoping for Erin Morgenstern to release some new books really soon!</span>\n",

That's that. Done. Finished. Three Hundred Eighty Seven pages. I read every one. It was a task. It was a chore. It became drudgery. It was work. This review is cathartic in nature.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying I'm a better writer than <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4370565.Erin_Morgenstern\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Erin Morgenstern\">Erin Morgenstern</a>. I certainly could not have written <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12025202.The_Night_Circus\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern\">The Night Circus</a>. Although I have written a great deal, I've not attempted publication. No guts, no glory. Fear of rejection, and all that, I suppose. Not so for Ms. Morgenstern whose book was optioned by Summit Pictures, before it was completed, a fact that Ms. Morgenstern has candidly said caused her to change her own work to fit a medium for which she didn't originally intend <i>The Night Circus</i>. Could this be the next \"Twilight\" franchise? Summit Pictures certainly must think so. And Doubleday's first print run was 125,000 copies. A lot of folks have jumped on <i>The Night Circus</i> band wagon. I've had my spin. You can keep your \"Silver Ticket.\"<br/><br/>Actually, the language of Morgenstern's book can be achingly lovely. However, I found the plot to be a random string of vignettes pushed together between a lovely dust jacket and tied up with a pretty bow. Characterization is almost absent. Ah, the play's the thing!<br/><br/>So, here we have the tale of two rival magicians, battling through time, pitting children whom they raise in seeming social isolation to be bound to one another in a duel to the death. Mr. A.H., the man in the gray suit takes Marco from an orphanage. Hector \"Prospero\" puts up his own illegitimate daughter for a challenge in which she might die. A fine figure of a father, who in his own desire to win is willing to slice open his daughter's fingers so she can learn to mend them through the power of magic--a man so cruel that he crushes her wrist with a paper weight for another exercise in repairing herself.<br/><br/>For this challenge, the venue is <i>Le Cirque des Reves</i>, a mysterious operation seemingly owned by Chandresh LeFevre, aided by a curious group of comrades. They supply the money and the physical skeleton of the circus. However, it is Marco and Celia, Prospero's daughter, who are the heart of the circus. It is inevitable that the two individuals, one of whom must die in the challenge, fall in love. Wouldn't you know it.<br/><br/>In a clever twist, the color palate of the circus is black and white, where everything is real. But it is not. The circus is a place for dreamers who wish to live in a world that is not black and white. It serves as a retreat from the mundane, the real, the humdrum real world of real life.<br/><br/>Woven in intermittently we meet young Bailey who has visited the circus and fallen in love with Poppet, a red haired girl who must be as beguiling to him as that \"little red haired girl\" for whom Charlie Brown swooned. And we follow Bailey as he attempt through time to find the circus once more to find his first love. It is also a convenient device that might allow a sequel, too. Fancy that. Doubleday and Summit Pictures must be pleased. Frankly, Scarlet, I don't give a damn.<br/><br/>A multitude of readers have tried and tried to find a deeper level of meaning to Erin Morgenstern's novel. After all, one of the characters is named Prospero. Ah, it must be an allusion to Shakespeare's <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12985.The_Tempest\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"The Tempest by William Shakespeare\">The Tempest</a>. About as close as I can come to that is that Prospero happens to be a magician and he has a daughter. <br/><br/>I certainly can't divine the origins of <i>The Night Circus</i> in Ms. Morgenstern's mind. Only the author can tell us that. But it takes more than a quote from <i>The Tempest</i> which the elfin author adroitly slips in towards the end. For this reader, I found vestiges of <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/248596.Something_Wicked_This_Way_Comes\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Something Wicked This Way Comes by Ray Bradbury\">Something Wicked This Way Comes</a> by <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1630.Ray_Bradbury\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Ray Bradbury\">Ray Bradbury</a>, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/239239.The_Prestige\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"The Prestige by Christopher Priest\">The Prestige</a> by <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/23419.Christopher_Priest\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Christopher Priest\">Christopher Priest</a>, with a touch of <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6310.Charlie_and_the_Chocolate_Factory\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory by Roald Dahl\">Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</a>, by <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4273.Roald_Dahl\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Roald Dahl\">Roald Dahl</a>. Unfortunately I can't say Ms. Morgenstern comes close to the mastery of those predecessors, although she joins their ranks by having her novel adapted as a movie.<br/><br/>If you simply have to find an appropriate allusion from <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/947.William_Shakespeare\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"William Shakespeare\">William Shakespeare</a>, I eschew <i>The Tempest</i> and opt for <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8852.Macbeth\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Macbeth by William Shakespeare\">Macbeth</a>:<br/><br/><blockquote>To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,<br/>Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,<br/>To the last syllable of recorded time;<br/>And all our yesterdays have lighted fools<br/>The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!<br/>Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player,<br/>That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,<br/>And then is heard no more. It is a tale<br/>Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,<br/>Signifying nothing.<br/><br/><b>Macbeth Act 5, scene 5, 19â28</b>\"</blockquote><br/><br/>Now, for the readers whose hackles are rising, thinking I've called Ms. Morgenstern an idiot, I respond, not so. Far from it. No, Ms. Morgenstern is cunning as a fox, even attending Comic-Con 2011 to promote <i>The Night Circus</i> before its publication by Doubleday. An artifice is:<br/><br/><blockquote>1<br/>a : clever or artful skill : ingenuity <br/>b : an ingenious device or expedient<br/>2<br/>a : an artful stratagem : trick<br/>b : false or insincere behavior </blockquote><br/><br/><a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/artifice\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictio...</a><br/><br/>I leave it to other readers to decide how many of the above apply to <i>The Night Circus</i>. But, it was just not my cup of tea.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></span>\n",

       "<span id=\"freeText1505917159242193108\" style=\"display:none\">I have read and enjoyed all the Harry Potter books. In a way, I consider them my friends. <i>The Night Circus</i> is no Harry Potter, despite the marketing dreams of Doubleday management. <br/><br/>It is a fantastical battle/love story, set at the turn of the 20th century, that summons the imagery and characterizations of Shakespeareâs <i>The Tempest</i>. The primary thrust here is the battle. Two children are chosen as stand-ins for an ages-old competition between two mysterious and seemingly immortal wizard-types. One might see in this a contemporary commentary on the history of civilization sending young people off to die for foolish reasons. But I do not really think that was the intent. The two are Marco, plucked from an orphanage by the grey-suited man (I found myself always thinking The Man in the Yellow Hat for some reason) and Celia, the daughter of a magician stage-named Prospero. If that sounds a bit familiar it is because, in <i>The Tempest</i>, Prospero is the main character. Our version seems to feel a compulsion to call his daughter, Celia, by the name Miranda, the name of Prosperoâs daughter in the elder work, but she resists. We must presume the author is winking and nodding and urging us to brush up our Shakespeare. <br/><br/>Our Prospero, off-stage-named Hector Bowen, and the never fully-named grey-suited character have staged this contest many times before. These two think little of manipulating actual people for their dubious pleasures. The venue is to be the circus, and the rules are inscrutable. The two children are trained in the magic arts by their respective elders for their entire youth, preparing them for a competition to prove whose pet is superior. They eventually meet and fall in love, of course, which complicates things. Overall, I thought this was a pretty nifty notion. I only wish Morgenstern had paid more attention to the romance between these two and was less enamored of her own compulsion to engage in feats of literary legerdemain. I found her scenes with the two very effective. <br/><br/>The book is rife with descriptive smoke and mirrors, a bit too much so. OK, way too much so. I cannot recall reading a book that paid quite so much obvious attention to its color palette. I know that might make it sound pretentious, but I think that works rather well here, to a point. I was reminded of the Langella <i>Dracula</i> production on Broadway more than a few years back. The entire stage was monochromatic, which made the red flower sitting in a vase stand out like a beacon. Ditto here. With everything portrayed in black, white, and shades between, whenever color emerges it catches the eye. It is not too hard to find the place from which this emanates. <blockquote>In an interview at Comic-Con in San Diegoâ¦Morgenstern, 33, who also is a painter, told USA TODAY that before she ever had characters, she visualized the colorful performers and contrasting black and white tones of the tents and circus setting. <br/>\"I paint very messy. I throw paint around,\" says Morgenstern, who now lives in Boston. \"So when I let myself do the same sort of thing with my writing, and I would just write and write and write and revise, that's when I found my rhythm in writing.\" <i>(<a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2011-07-25-erin-morgenstern-night-circus_n.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.usatoday.com/life/books/ne...</a>)</i></blockquote> What is the coloring supposed to indicate? What is she saying here? I do not know, but it does stand out. And that is an indicator of a potential problem. If there is a technique being used so loudly that serves little clear purpose, then why is it being used?<br/><br/>A Tarot motif also figures throughout, so those of you who are not seers or special readers, start your search engines to suss out what each of the many mentioned cards might portend. And set your search for the Marseilles deck. Morgenstern uses her tarot references to add info about her characters, and a tarot-reading seer to grease those wheels. This one is a knight. That one is a magician. Usually the references are pretty obvious, so, ultimately, with an exception here or there, the cards as indicators of character do not really add much. And raise your hands, anyone who thinks a seer might overlook something close to home.<br/><br/>Dreams figure large â the gigantic clock commissioned for the circus is named <i>Wunschtraum</i> which translates from the German to âPipe Dream.â The proper name of the circus, <i>Le Cirques de Reve</i>, translates to the âCircus of Dreamsâ and followers of the circus are called <i>reveurs</i>, or dreamers. There is a host of other references to and uses of the dreaming motif but I will not list them all here. <br/><br/>Some of Morgensternâs subsidiary characters were fun. The Murray twins, red-haired (Weasleyan?) spawn of big-cat tamers are fun, both possessed with powers, and both performers who, charmingly, use kittens in their act. How could you not love characters named Widget and Poppett? Poppet in particular gets a bit more stage time, and should have gotten even more. <br/><br/>A young man named Bailey (I couldn't decide if this was more for the reference to Barnum and Bailey or to George Bailey, as this pure-hearted lad was living a dull life and yearned for more) is engaging and gives us another character to root for. But again, not nearly enough time is given him. <br/><br/>The two wizards remain mostly discorporate. Celiaâs father is actively seeking a way out of the material world, and the man in the grey suit maintains his cipher-hood throughout. They sneak and lurk a lot but rarely seem to do any actual harm, with one obvious exception involving a knife.<br/><br/>Morgenstern was clearly so in love with all her magic tricks that she lost focus. What is it that engages readers, makes us care? It is characters. We can certainly enjoy and appreciate beautiful descriptions and thrill at the qualities with which she imbues her world. There is a huge amount of creativity on display here. Lots of smoke and mirrors (literally), lots of bright lights, misdirections, shiny objects, many pretty pictures, and a cauldron-full of magic. I am sure that in the right hands, when this is made into a major motion picture (rights have already been bought) there will be Oscar opportunities aplenty for art directors, costume and makeup designers, and special effects pros. But I felt that there was twenty pounds of sizzle here for a two ounce steak. The emphasis was all on the tricks, the cleverness, the <i>magic</i>, and not nearly enough on the core love story. Morgenstern clearly can make her characters breathe. She does that here, but too infrequently to keep us from getting distracted by the sparkly things. I had the impression that she was intent on throwing into her brew-pot every idea that she could get away with. For example, it wasn't enough for her to hew to her core Tempest imagery with the captured-in-a-tree piece, which certainly works in the story. She felt a need to embellish by dragging Merlin in as well. Please, enough already. We got the picture. You do not have to color it in for us. <br/><br/>Pick your motifs, Tarot, Tempest, rings, color scheme, tree/vine imagery, time, star-crossed love, mirrors, books and reading. Go ahead, follow one, two, three, four, five. In moderation there is so much here to like, but in excess it overwhelms and detracts. Save a few tricks for the next volume, if there is to be one. Rowling paced herself and offered a useful model to follow. Morgenstern, as she does with paint, also does with words. She throws lots of stuff up there and then revises and revises. She reports that she had to do a lot of revision on this book, which makes me wonder what this looked like when it was first submitted. That it emerged in all its finery, but lacking sufficient attention to the characters represents, I expect, a problem with editing. Couldn't someone have told Erin, hey, tone back the jazz and focus on the tune? Or maybe someone did and she did not comply. Canât say. Donât know. <br/><br/>There was a chapter near the end, <i>Stories</i>, which was so cloying and pretentious that it was gag-inducing. Not a great way to head towards the finish line.<br/><br/>I know the overall timbre of this review is critical. But I need to add in here that <i>The Night Circus</i> remains an engaging, interesting read, and I enjoyed it. My gripe is that it could have been sooooo much better with a good spell of discipline. Still this is an impressive first novel. Maybe in her next work, the bubbling talent on display here can be harnessed to concoct a more effective, more focused book. A guy can dream.<br/><br/>PS<br/><br/>I take issue with the bookâs cover design, which makes it appear that the circus is a toy in the hand of a particular significant character. This is not the case. The circus venue is agreed to by the two god-like characters, and it is kept magical by a host of contributors. No single hand controls all, as the cover suggests. The UK cover uses the same black and white scheme, but eschews the single hand for silhouettes of Marco and Celia. The ARE version was better still, simplifying even more.<br/></span>\n",

Maybe I just didn't get it, maybe I was just too sleepy, either way, that's how it is. <br/><br/>I very much loved different parts of the book that seemed so magical and I don't mean..pull a rabbit out of your hat.. I mean the story line, how the author told it in such a way that you felt transported to another time. I would love to go to this circus! I would probably spend most of my time in the ice garden, but I love the cold sooo.... It just sounds like a magical place to be and I wish we could have read more about the things going on in the tents. <br/><br/>I love Celia and Marco. I do not like they were pitted against each other by their masters to see who will win in the \"magic\" game. I think these two were such sweet characters even if their masters weren't all that great to them. Well, Celia's father was her master and he seemed pretty evil. I will leave that for you to read about. <br/><br/>I would like to try this book again another day to see if I can get my head around the parts I just didn't get. I think this book has a lot of magic inside. :)<br/><br/><img alt=\" : \" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1448912596i/17205493.jpg\"/><br/></span>\n",

       "['The Night Circus is like cake. Cake without frosting. Sure, cake is good, some people will even prefer dry, plain cake all by itself, but others, such as myself, need the sugary sweetness of frosting. Some may prefer the milder whip frosting. Or maybe even caramel or candy to put the final touches on our taste buds. Either way, plain cake, no matter how moist, is not for everyone.Yes, the writing is beautiful. Beyond beautiful. It\\'s magnificent and breathtaking; the detailed scenery, the magic, the multitude of formidable descriptions of each tent inside this circus is all absolutely stunning. Furthermore, the approach taken to tell the story is excellent. We\\'ve got the journey in past and present, walking alongside the characters their whole lives, in addition, we get our very own walk inside this resplendent circus which adds a truly delightful touch to the story. Unfortunately, this is the only aspect of the book I enjoyed: The writing. While I appreciate more literary books, -- a lot of my favorites are slow paced, extremely well-read books that managed to not only tell me a story, but actually make me live it -- The Night Circus\\' strongly lethargic plot fails to let it radiate life within its beauty. Filling a book with pizzazz is simply not enough for me. I need a compelling storyline, I need fabulous characters. This is where I was left highly underwhelmed. The \"competition\" we constantly hear of is kept very vague, not really letting us in which only left me confused as to the point of the plot, not to mention let down by the absence of its \"fierceness\" that the blurb promises. Knowing that sometimes all I need is a little patience to eventually get blown away, I kept my hopes up and didn\\'t give up. I was slightly more satisfied at the end, very slightly, though I was expecting much more out of this highly praised novel. If you want to read a book to simply enjoy its outward extravagance, I can see you loving it. However, expect over 500 pages of nothing more. Strong characters can make a world of difference in books such as this. Characters I would have grown to love, to adore. Characters that would have made an impression on me emotionally. A deep investment in such characters could have made this an instant favorite. Instead what I got were colorless characters with weak personalities that I could not have been less concerned about. Maybe I was distracted by the glamor (catch-22?), maybe it was all the back and forth; whatever the reason, these characters remained characters to me. I never got to know them. I never got to feel their presence, their soul, inside this tale. Where it should have been filled with passion and devotion, sometimes misery, this was only communicated with sentences, not with the actual emotions I was expected to garner. The only character I was mildly interested in was Bailey and his parts, though not insignificant, are far and few. Your enjoyment of this book will seriously depend on what you\\'re looking for. It\\'s an exquisitely well-written book full of riches and gorgeous descriptions. If this is enough to lure you in and enchant you - I assure you you will be blown away. If an engaging plot and great characterization are also essential for you to have a great reading experience, you won\\'t find it here. Ultimately, you\\'ll either love it, or you won\\'t. Me, I need my frosting. --For more of my reviews, visit my blog at Xpresso Reads \\n',\n",
       " \"[Celia and Marco rarely appear on the stage together. You see the competition between them, you see that it is real. But while Celia works with the circus and therefore lives surrounded by Marco's creations, Marco doesn't. It is understanble that Celia falls in love with the conceiver of the attractions so dear to her, but what about him? He doesn't know her.  (hide spoiler)]\",\n",
       " \"The Night Circus was lovely and entrancing: like a Victorian-era Cirque du Soleil decided to do a circus where spectators wander from tent to tent--except that some of the performers are truly magical. The plot is deceptively simple: two ageless magicians are engaged in a competition that spans decades and several matchups. In their current matchup, Each magician is training an apprentice, who are Marco and Celia, in their different methods of magic, so that the young pair can later compete at the Night Circus in a mysterious magical duel, where the rules are unclear and the stakes are unknown. The two young players have their own agenda, but they are locked into this duel by powers beyond their control.The tale is highly atmospheric, filled with mystical, enchanting imagery: Celia's ballgown changes color to match the clothing of whomever she is closest to; a room is filled with bottles that contain scents that transport your senses to places like a Christmas evening or an ocean beach; a carousel contains magical animals that seem half-alive.I can see how this might not be everyone's cuppa tea: it's very dreamlike, it randomly jumps around in time, and it's heavier on atmosphere than plot. But it was definitely my cup. I loved the lyrical language, the mystical, beautiful imagery, and the slow-building romance, with just enough of an edge to the story to make it really interesting.When the battles are fought and won and lost, when the pirates find their treasures and the dragons eat their foes for breakfast with a nice cup of Lapsang souchong, someone needs to tell their bits of overlapping narrative. There's magic in that. It's in the listener, and for each and every ear it will be different, and it will affect them in ways they can never predict.\",\n",
       " 'In a vacant lot, on the outskirts of late, Nineteenth- Century London, a strange thing appears, like magic, numerous tall tents, black and white in color, in the middle of the night, surrounded by a fence. How it got there so suddenly, hoisted without any noise or being seen, and most unusual, no publicity ... it\\'s a circus. But not like anything, anyone has ever gazed at, the sign says performances commence, only when the sun sets, unheard of, the money they will lose. Le Cirque des Reves , ( The Circus of Dreams), has many tents of different sizes and heights, yet no main one, customers roam around and choose their own pleasures, unfeasible, for just one day\\'s viewing, the preferences you can imagine, vary widely, some attractions are outside the canvases, on the ground. Nevertheless people are intrigued, they flock in long lines, to see the newest novelty, with a large wondrous clock, at its entrance, to conquer their boredom. In the domes, are the usual, death defying acrobats, without a net, wise fortune tellers, no animals, though, a contortionist, who\\'s body does painful looking flexing and bending, almost grotesque, an illusionist, Celia Bowen, who seems as if she has real magical powers, that amaze , but that is impossible, right? A murky, cloud maze, where customers climb high above the earth, trying to find a way out, without falling, snow, and ice, too, countless mirrors showing strange images, weird birds that look genuine, flying around the tents, lights that can not actually exist, sounds and objects from who knows where? There is an unworldly aspect about this place, that people feel, but will not acknowledge, after all, it is just an ordinary circus. Naturally followers quickly develop,\"Reveurs\", who perpetually go from city to city, after the unique carnival, always searching and communicating with their fellow travelers, wearing black and white clothes, with red scarves, asking constantly, where is the Night Circus? They need the excitement, the fantasy, the delight , and get away from their dull, empty lives. Still the the main story is Celia and Marco, two rivals, in an endless, deadly, wizardry game, that the loser will not survive this contest, arranged by her father Prospero the Enchanter, (Hector Bowen), a gifted magician, maybe too much so, and Alexander, ( not his real name), \" The Man in the Grey Suit\", who raised the orphan, called now, Marco Alisdair. These selfish men with supernatural abilities, pit their children against each other, for their sick amusement. But the attractive rivals start to like each other, (love is in the air), against everything they were taught... Still one must perish ... A fairy tale for grownups, with enough magic, romance , mystery and tragedy, to satisfy every person interested in great entertainment, ultimately, the unknown is always fun to read about, from the safety of our homes ...',\n",
       " \"THE NIGHT CIRCUS is magical realism at its most fun. The major storyline pits two young magicians (and two schools of thought) in a mysterious battle set in a traveling night circus. The circus is both the main and most interesting character. The secondary story line involves a young boy in Massachusetts who visits the circus and returns as a young man. The tertiary story line involves you, the reader, walking through the circus in the present day. The structure of the book mimics the circus where it's set: short, captivating chapters, each a feat to take your breath away. As you read from one to the next, the marvels pile up, the plot lines converge, and you're left wondering how the whole thing was even possible.There's also the sensory overload of fantastical, wildly original sights that defy physics, sweet and savory smells drifting across chapters, and the kind of perfectly delicious foods that only exists in the imagination. It left me as happily dizzied and awe-struck as a reveur.A few of my favorite things about the novel: Widget and Poppet (nicknames) are twins born in the circus. Widget's story to his sister of a wizard and a tree might be the best bedtime story I've ever read. Also, I love how Morgenstern ends so many chapters, not with a cliff hanger to get you reading on, but with a dramatic flourish that'll lead you to reflect on what's already happened.Caveats: The plot takes a little while to rev up, but this is fine considering the beautiful writing that sets the stage. There are a number of plot lines mentioned only in hints and rumors, and Morgenstern relies on these to add depth. I enjoyed that, but some people might not. All in all, this is a wonderful book I feel comfortable recommending to anyone, regardless of their reading tastes. Five stars.\",\n",
       " 'I have quite honestly never had the pleasure of reading a more beautiful book. I want to go back to the beginning and read it all over again. I just....I have no words. ',\n",
       " 'Have you ever played \"Never Have I Ever\"? Ten days ago I could ask myself several questions and walk away quite sober. Questions like...Never have I ever stalked on author two chapters into reading their book.Never have I ever created a Pinterest board...for another author\\'s book.Never have I ever ordered the special edition signed hardcopy for three easy payments of just $38 before I\\'ve even finished the eBook.Never have I ever decided to get a tattoo that\\'s \"just so totally me\" after reading another author\\'s book. Never have I ever wanted to redecorate my house to submerge myself in another author\\'s world.Suffice it to say, I\\'m quite drunk now. I\\'ve read hundreds of books, and never have I ever felt, after finishing one, that my view of the world is just a little bit prettier because of it. Until this one. Don\\'t get me wrong. I\\'ve read some great books that made me happy, and taken things away from them, loved them, and wanted to reread them. I\\'ve adored characters, settings, the authors\\' writing, but it\\'s not often I want to live inside the story. It\\'s not often that I really, really, really want it to be real. The Night Circus was more than just a story. It was an experience for me, and anyone reading it should remember that you\\'re not getting a quick, easy instant gratification read. You\\'re getting a dream. Morgenstern takes you into the circus, makes you a part of it with a handful of sporadically placed 2nd person point-of-view scenes, and colors the pictures for you. How everything looks, smells, tastes, feels, and sounds, and you find yourself wondering about the mysterious life of these performers. So the circus merely appears. Who\\'s setting it up? What does everyone do when the circus is not open? Do they even exist? Are they vulnerable to death, sickness, or outside influence? What happens if Celia or Marco just stop their battle? What\\'s the prize for winning? Most often while reading a book, I\\'ll flip to the last page if I start to feel nervous about the ending. Or I\\'ll go on Amazon and read reviews to connect, in some way, with other readers who\\'ve read it. With this book, though, I couldn\\'t bring myself to do either. I wanted to love it, and I didn\\'t want anyone else giving me reasons not to finish. The story was expertly planned, beautifully written, and Morgenstern\\'s hard work deserved my solid effort to resist the temptation of looking for spoilers. So I held back. And I was not disappointed. I\\'m glad I experienced the book unspoiled. Several times during reading I had to remind myself that this was not a romance. I kept getting aggravated that the hero and heroine weren\\'t in many scenes together at first, until I remembered that while there is a romance in it, the novel is primarily a fantasy. So be patient. The circus needs to be set up, the players put into place, and the slow burn is well worth the wait. Seeing Celia and Marco dance around each other was wonderfully agonizing. And those of you apprehensive about historicals, rest assured this book doesn\\'t focus on details of the era so much. It\\'s simply the backdrop. So yes, I loved it. I loved how the author kept revealing secrets to the end, I love that she gave us a worthy ending, I love that this made me want to be a better writer, and I really need the movie. This is exactly the type of story that should be seen put to life, whether or not it truly does the story justice. I still want to see it. Hey, I\\'d even dress up for premiere night. Maybe with a red scarf and bowler hat. I don\\'t know. Maybe.Aw, who am I kidding? I\\'m going to wear a red scarf and bowler hat tomorrow. ;) ',\n",
       " \"This was a solidly entertaining read that really shone by the end for me. Mainly it was a historical fiction revolving around real magic that tied to a circus that only played at night, but these words do nothing to illustrate that it's really a character novel despite these very well done trappings of fantasy and historical literature.We follow Celia and Marco from their childhood and these poor kids are pitted against each other in a great magical game where only one can survive. While this could have turned into a huge fracas, it actually proceeds sedately and professionally as each child makes a career as illusionists performing real magic, until one day they discover each other.I'll be honest. I didn't really care for the book all that much until it became a romance. Odd, no? Well, that's where it took off for me, and I held on with great fear. :) The rest was great fun.Second to that, however, was the tone and the atmosphere. I understood a great love for the circus, with all the great care and tending it required, how the magic was bound to it and how things could be utterly messed up without that underlying spark. It was rather sweet and dreamy.\",\n",

       " \"**3.5 stars**\\n\\n''A circus?'' says Lainie Burgess with a smile. ''How marvelous!''''Like a carnival?'' Mr. Barris asks, sounding mildly confused.''More than a carnival,'' Chandresh says. ''More than a circus, really, like no circus anyone has ever seen. Not a single large tent but a multitude of tents, each with a particular exhibition. No elephants or clowns. No, something more refined than that. Nothing commonplace. This will be different, this will be an utterly unique experience, a feast for the senses. [...]\\n\\n This is quite an unique book and story. The cover is captivating, that is for sure. The story itself is very original and beautifully written. It started with an intriguing ambience, a magician, known as Prospero, discovering a daugther he never thought he had, who in fact has special abilities as himself. I would even say she is even more talented. The man in question decided to embark his daughter, Celia, in a long and mysterious competiton of which very few people know about. Her opponent will be chosen by one of Prospero's powerful acquaintances. The reason I decided to read this popular novel is simple. I love competitions. As I said in my review of Panic, I love the feeling of excitement and being able to choose 'my' winner and hoping he/she will be the one who will succeed until the end. In this book, it was a bit disappointing because the competition itself is but isn't at the same time the main attraction. Not many people know about it, so it is mainly a secret the two participants are keeping. They're actually trying to understand themselves what it is actually about. The synopsis is misleading us to think that it will exciting and mysterious and maybe fun, but it isn't quite like that. It sure is mysterious but than mostly annoying because you want to learn why the two men started it and what happens and when but it is very vague.The characters are interesting. A huge problem I had is that, at the beginning, I thought Celia was in fact Isobel all the time she was hanging with Marco. It changed my way of seeing those characters and I only discovered they were not after about half of the book. I would like to say it is my only fault but I can't because it truly was confusing. When Isobel first met Marco, she was shy and had a passion for magic, of course, but so was Celia. And they both had similar if not the same age. I'd like to warn you so you won't make the same mistake: Celia and Isobel are two different person.My favorite character at the beginning was Celia because she was a bit of a rebel but Bailey fastly took her place. His admiration for Le Cirque des RÃªves was adorable and interesting. I always wanted to know what would happen this time when he goes to the circus. It mostly was through him that we witnessed shows and breathtaking illusions. It is impossible to not like his calmness and charming nature. The romance wasn't rushed but it felt to me like it was a bit, even if there was some leap of time before the characters grew fond on each other. Marco and Isobel were bonded to each other since a young age, so I guess I can understand it. I obviously didn't predict it because I thought Celia was Isobel so that she already met Marco before and was just afraid to tell him that. Well...that's not what happened of course. After all, at least it wasn't cheesy as I thought so that made it quite enjoyable.Overall, I thought this was an interesting, well-written and especially different read with unique characters. It has an alternative POV and the chapters are actually back-and-forth in time ones. It didn't bother me because it made me always wonder what will the next chapter contain. I recommend The Night Circus to teenagers and adults.Images taken form this amazing Deviant Art artist: http://fluffball264.deviantart.com/Also posted on Seeing Night Reviews\",\n",
       " \"3ish stars.Several words that describe this book: mystifying, sensory, charming, atmospheric, dream-like, eerie, elegant, ethereal, lyrical, thought-provoking .This circus, wow. I will have dreams about this circus. I'm just as disappointed that I can't go to this circus as I am that I never got an owl inviting me to attend Hogwarts. The imagery of the circus is incredible. Words that do not describe this book: progressive, structured, plot-based.As charming as the characters are (the Murray twins in particular), I was more worried about the fate of the circus than about what happened to Marco or Celia or anyone else. I honestly wasn't that interested in the story. I didn't get that ending but wasn't invested enough to be particularly worried about it. It's very thought-provoking and (purposefully?) metaphorical. It's also very lovely but feels more like a character study (the character being the circus, of course, and by extension life itself??) than a complete novel. I understand the adoration of many readers and I truly enjoyed it even if I didn't love it.Jim Dale gives a typically fantastic audiobook performance.\",\n",

       " \"***NO SPOILERS***I donâ\\x80\\x99t know that itâ\\x80\\x99s ever happened that Iâ\\x80\\x99ve read a book and felt the summary on its dust jacket sounded better than what I actually read (edited, June 3, 2016: Boy, Snow, Bird is now possibly a worse offender). Itâ\\x80\\x99s the other way around, usually; the summary doesnâ\\x80\\x99t do the actual story justice, or it might not even reveal that much. Not with this book. When it first hit bookstores, publishers marketed The Night Circus as â\\x80\\x9cthe next Harry Potter,â\\x80\\x9d which, every time I recall this con, makes me want to tear my pretty hardback copy into tiny pieces and light them on fire. The Night Circus promises an electrifying romance between dueling illusionists, Celia and Marco, who are fighting to the death: â\\x80\\x9cUnbeknownst to the players, this is a game in which only one can be left standing, and the circus is but the stage for a remarkable battle of imagination and will.â\\x80\\x9d Well, as it turns out, the â\\x80\\x9cduelâ\\x80\\x9d is not a battle at all; it is a series of illusions--at the circus--that each creates to impress the other over the course of more than ten years. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s no rush to conclude this â\\x80\\x9cduel,â\\x80\\x9d apparently. That lack of urgency makes for a very yawn-inducing story, particularly at the storyâ\\x80\\x99s halfway point. I was most looking forward to getting to this part of the story: â\\x80\\x9c...they innocently tumble head-first into love. A deep, passionate, and magical love that makes the lights flicker and the room grow warm whenever they so much as brush hands.â\\x80\\x9d I was sorely disappointed. Celia and Marco somehow fall in love; Morgenstern never showed the development of their love. For their first few interactions, Celia plays it cool with Marco; then the moment she doesn't play it cool is the moment Cupid hits his mark. They touch hands at one point, and something happens with the lights. That happens twice in the entire 387 pages, if that. Given how this light-flickering made it into the summary, however, youâ\\x80\\x99d think these two were causing regular brownouts; furthermore, thereâ\\x80\\x99s nothing deep or passionate about this coupleâ\\x80\\x99s love. The lone sex scene in the book is a literal bodice-ripper, and itâ\\x80\\x99s clichÃ©d and dispassionate. Morgenstern tried her damnedest, but there's zero heat between these two, no matter how warm they make the room simply by brushing hands. The Night Circus contains an extensive cast of characters who are more mysterious than they have any right to be and are very shallowly drawn. Who is Prospero, really? Who is Mr. A.H., really? Here are two intriguing characters portrayed as having possible psychopathic tendencies, yet they are nothing but shadows in the story. Marco is impossible to like at times, which I question was Morgenstern's intention. Celia is almost more noteworthy for her gowns than for her personality. Isobel is a pining, ignored, sad sack character who wastes time searching for answers in tarot cards. The list goes on. Each character can be perfectly, thoroughly summarized in a single sentence. The descriptions are excessive to the point of being purple, slowing the storyâ\\x80\\x99s momentum each and every time. Morgenstern paid extreme attention to writing detail at the expense of writing a solid, organized plot that clips along at a steady pace. Pretty, unique descriptions do not a story make; the all-important plot and three-dimensional character development must be in place before anything else. Focusing on descriptions while sacrificing plot and character development is like buying an entire houseâ\\x80\\x99s worth of furniture when you have no house to put it in. I think one of the best pieces of writing advice Iâ\\x80\\x99ve ever read after â\\x80\\x9cshow, don't tell,â\\x80\\x9d is William Faulknerâ\\x80\\x99s instruction to â\\x80\\x9ckill your darlings.â\\x80\\x9d If Morgenstern had killed her darlings, The Night Circus would be shorter by at least one-third and possibly, hopefully, have a tighter plot while being a little more fun to readâ\\x80\\x94albeit with the same one-dimensional, unknowable characters.Final verdict: Skip without reservation and read the Harry Potter series instead for true magic in book form.\",\n",
       " \"5 beautiful stars for a breathtaking journey into a world of magic and top hats.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLike stepping into a fairy tale under a curtain of stars.â\\x80\\x9d \\n\\nThe Night Circus was the book that made me realize fantasy was the genre for me. It was the first book I read that made me realize how much I missed reading since I was a child. It will always hold a very special place in my heart. That being said... I want to be honest about what to expect if you're considering reading this book. I think the description can be a bit deceiving. While the story is breathtakingly beautiful, it is quite slow moving. It is rich in detail and every chapter feels like a work of art. The description makes it feel like this will be a fast paced and intense duel-to-the-death plot... but please be warned that this is not the case. The duel between the two magicians is very abstract and spans the course of several years. This story is meant to be savored, preferably with a serving of chocolate.I still can't help but adore this book to pieces. It is told from multiple POVs and even different times. You'll be following your POV (yes... you are a character in this book and no, I'm not joking and it is super cool..) alongside of the past and the future. Don't let it scare you- I don't think its too confusing.. and everything is building up towards the end. I can't rave enough about the characters. Celia and Marco (the two magicians who inevitably fall in love) have such an interesting dynamic. Their chemistry and curiosity for each other is off the charts. I enjoyed every scene with them together (and oh my word.. the scene where Celia leaves her shaw... helloooo goosebumps.) \\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI would have written you, myself, if I could put down in words everything I want to say to you. A sea of ink would not be enough.' 'But you built me dreams instead.â\\x80\\x9d \\n\\nDon't underestimate the side characters either. Widget and Poppet are the most adorbs characters ever. Their story (along with Bailey's) is really neat as it plays out. Not to mention- they are hysterical! And the world? Completely stunning and artistic - with a dash of steampunk awesomeness. All in all, I highly recommend this to anyone with a love for magicians, mystery, romance, historical fiction, and timepieces. I should also note that I listened to the audiobook which is narrated by Jim Dale (the same narrator from Harry Potter) - and I HIGHLY recommend it. My Blog ~ Instagram\",\n",
       " 'This review will not recap the story, but below are my general thoughts on the book. http://welovedystopianromance.blogspo...I really, really wanted to like this book. Everyone and every review (okay maybe not every,) but the majority say that this is the best book in forever. I might be in the unpopular opinion here, but I would have wanted someone to tell me that the book\\'s official summary is misleading. I was lead to believe that this was going to be non-stop action book, by this statement: \"...a fierce competition is under way-- a dual between two young magicians...\" And... It\\'s not. WHY I READ IT: I was able to win an ARC copy (one that I was extremely excited about), it has more five star reviews than not, rave reviews, and it has a confirmed film deal. (Maybe I shouldn\\'t have know that there was a film deal, because I kept thinking that there was no way for this to be seen on film, and I think w/ the lack of action, it might make people fall asleep.) Overall, the book left me with shrugged shoulders. I wouldn\\'t say I regretted reading it, but I wouldn\\'t necessarily say it was enjoyable either. WHAT I LIKED: I like the circus setting, the \"magic\", and at points I was rushing through the pages to see what was happening next. The imagery and details of the circus were beautiful, but there were somethings I just could not visualize. Maybe that\\'s the point?  WHAT I DIDN\\'T LIKE:  The book has time jumps that at first make things very confusing. It also introduces many characters at once. I found myself flipping back to see who they were and in what year I was reading. I understand it\\'s done to hold the reader\\'s interest, but it is mostly distracting. It makes the reader feel distant from the characters, at least that\\'s what it did for me. The characters they introduce are of importance, but I\\'d rather the story not focus on certain characters to give me more of the characters that mattered to me the most: Celia, Marco, Bailey, Poppet and Widget. Although I cared for these characters, I really felt like I didn\\'t connect as much as I\\'d like to have or I should have. Also, I like reading books with a great romance aspect, and it was being hyped as this super romantic book, so maybe that was the downfall? I thought this romance would be of EPIC proportions. It was sweet, but it is easily forgettable...just like the entire story. Sorry, I just don\\'t get how this is a five-star book--at all.',\n",
       " '(Actual Rating: 3.5 stars)Erin Morgenstern\\'s debut novel, The Night Circus, is a book bound to divide book lovers into the \"loved it\" and \"hated it\" categories. Some people will adore the prose; others will despise it for being flowery and excessive. Some readers will hate the false promises the blurb on the jacket copy offers; others will still find something magical to love and admire in this novel despite the deception within the blurb. As for me, I was divided in my opinions. I mean, I really, really wanted that story the blurb promised about a \"fierce competition\" and \"a deep, passionate, and magical love.\" I still want someone to write it since, sadly, Morgenstern didn\\'t give it to me.What Morgenstern did give me, however, was a lovely novel about the passage of time surrounding a circus concocted by magical means. The circus here is not just a location: it too is a character, one that is more vibrant than many of the other characters within this story. Morgenstern succeeds at making the magic wondrous and enchanting, although those looking for the rules to the enchantments will come away disappointed. There is no rhyme or reason to the magic here: it simply is, and that is as much a strength as it is a deficit.The novel has no consistent timeline or narrative either, given that the chapters alternate among the past and present, standalone moments from the circus itself, and character viewpoints of varying importance. Although The Night Circus contains literary merit, it doesn\\'t have quite enough spark to achieve everything all its build-up promised.Le Cirque des RÃªves (The Circus of Dreams) has an uncommon inception within London in 1873: two gentlemen, one who calls himself Prospero and the other who dons a grey suit and is known as Alexander, make a wager that two pupils of theirs will undergo a magical competition. Prospero\\'s choice is his daughter, Celia, whom he has only been aware of for the past six months. Alexander, however, does not make his choice until the following January: an orphaned boy whose name Alexander does not care to know. These two children become bound together by a magical pact, but they remain unaware of each other for many years. Only once the magical circus, the chosen venue for the competition, is in its planning stages does the real game begin...\"Competition\" doesn\\'t quite fit what transpires within the circus because of the magic of Celia and Marco (the orphaned boy). There are no showdowns, no competitive scenes, no dangerous moments. Instead, the novel showcases how Celia and Marco try to one-up each other with how enchanting their various contributions to the circus can be. These enchantments, however, devolve into almost a flirtation between the two as they silently create new tents and exhibits for the sole purpose of impressing one another. It\\'s a nice idea, but it would have born more weight if both sides had been aware of each other\\'s identities sooner in the novel. Somehow, we\\'re meant to believe that, with so much secrecy abounding, these two can honestly, truly fall in love. And that is one of the greatest flaws within The Night Circus: the love story is not deep, passionate, dangerous, or even really sensical, and it makes the story weaker than it otherwise might have been.The first meaningful conversation between Celia and Marco occurs halfway through the book. Then, Morgenstern does the unthinkable: the next chapter is set three years later, and suddenly Marco is proclaiming, \"I\\'m in love with her.\" Really? Really? There needed to be some transition between the two chapters, something to bridge the gap to show that something was growing in the hearts of these two individuals now that they were both aware of one another. Instead, the love between the two is shoddy and gimmicky, the stuff of an hour-and-a-half movie rather than a nearly 400-page novel with a literary bent.Now, you must be wondering: \"Jillian, if you had such a problem with the love story, why give the novel three-and-a-half stars?\" Because the novel isn\\'t just the love story. There was plenty more for me to like in this novel: the segments about the circus\\'s various attractions, a plot line following a boy named Bailey who\\'s in love with the circus, and the inclusion of rÃªveurs (dreamers) who follow the circus around the world. Basically, the circus is the main character...and, given what I read about it, I knew that if such a place existed I would probably be in love with it too. So I couldn\\'t dislike the novel simply because the story introduced me to such an intriguing, enchanting place.All my qualms and opinions aside, The Night Circus is a charming story, but it won\\'t be for everyone simply because it\\'s not as universal as it could have been. It may be a literary smash-hit for a time, but will it be a classic read in the decades to come? I doubt it. However, if Erin Morgenstern can hone her craft a bit more, then maybe someday she really will become a household name. For now, though, The Night Circus is the debut novel that will either enchant or alienate readers. Whether you will be one or the other, that all depends on how you fare with the circus and its offerings if you give this novel a go.',\n",
       " '\"How tempting it is to lose myself in you. To let you keep me from breaking chandeliers rather than constantly worrying about it myself.\"This story was spectacular! Although it took me an immensely long time to read, I really wanted to be able to take everything in and understand how each different story line connected. It is an incredibly detailed and descriptive novel, which I understand can definitely hinder the experience for certain readers. This was not the case with me as I live for description. I love being able to visualize so clearly that the novel is almost like a movie playing in my mind. The atmosphere was also incredible. I truly wish I could go to a circus like this, and experience everything that there is within this magical place. Erin Morgenstern really put so much effort and love into creating every detail, whether it be of The Night Circus itself, or the characters. Speaking of which, the characters are what made this book for me. They were phenomenal. Every single character was so rich, and well developed. Although these characters were magical and were out of the ordinary, they were still flawed, which makes them much more realistic, and allows the reader to understand the thought process behind certain decisions. Celia Bowen was so delicately crafted, and was an absolute treat to read about. She had a temper like no other, but used it to power herself and create her illusions rather than let it ruin her. She understood consequences and was very smart in her own ways, and never once made a decision where I thought \\'oh no, here we go\\', which in my books is definitely a plus. She was so intricate and well developed, to the point of seeing her within myself. Marco Alisdair was incredible to read about as well. He was charming, and effortless, and so incredibly fascinating. He never pretended to be more than he was, and acted as though he much more ordinary than one would assume. I really connected with him for reasons I can\\'t overly explain, most likely for his flawed nature, making him seem real. His tension with Celia was unbearable, and they truly do belong together. I think my personal favourite characters were the Murray twins, Poppet and Widget. They brought the book to life for me, with their talents, their descriptions, and especially their stories, which come to play towards the end. Even being so incredibly young throughout the novel, the oldest being sixteen, they are still so incredibly developed, and their decisions and thoughts, while also being flawed, are understandable. Their youth made the story more lighthearted, which was an added bonus. Included with them is Bailey, who was a wonderful addition, and an amazing twist. He is the epitome of every child/teenager who doesn\\'t know what to do, but given the options, none appeal to them. I loved his parts in the story, and appreciated his struggles. I can\\'t forget about Tsukiko, who spewed some of the greatest lines I\\'ve ever read in a book, and had such immense strength that inspires you, and makes you understand that strength is really found within. Herr Friedrick Thiessen, whose love for the circus was incomprehensible, and contrasted immensely with the other forms of love throughout the story. There were the supposed villains, and I say supposed because they are not really villains, but people with a flawed view on reality due to the fact that they themselves do not understand it the way mere mortals might. To not give away spoilers, I will not mention who, or why this is. As this story is mostly character driven, the plot is quite a bit slower but I do not think that this takes away from the novel whatsoever. This allows the reader to be able to immerse themselves within the story and understand each and every chapter and how they all connect in the end. I did take away half a star simply because this was quite hard to understand and grasp at certain points, and some pages or chapters I had to reread to simply get an idea of what was going on. I really did love this book overall and highly recommend it to anyone who is trying to delve into adult fantasy, as that was the case with me. I think the story will capture your attention, and the wonderful descriptions will only carry you forward. I will definitely be giving this a reread in the near future, as there are still a few things that I think I may have missed. I connected with the story and the characters, and for me that is always a priority. Overall, a fantastically flawed novel that everyone should read. 4.5/5 stars! ',\n",
       " \"Edit: Okay I've re-read The Night Circus recently and was absolutely blown away again. I know in my review I initially gave it a 4 stars because of the lack lustre ending, the poor world building and the illogical plot points but the journey The Night Circus took me on was so intriguing and beautiful that all this didn't really matter to me at all. On a 2nd read, The Night Circus really comes to life as it shines like a beacon in the night sky. There's so much detail that I got to appreciate on my 2nd read, it was as if I had taken an entirely different journey all together. This is why I have decided to award this book a 5 stars despite all it's flaws.Sometimes it is always about the journey and not the destination. The finest of pleasures are always the unexpected onesThe Night Circus is going to be one of those books you'd either get sucked into and get totally engrossed or the kinda that gets you scratching your head and thinking 'ok can we please get on with the plot?'. Why? Cause the nonlinear storyline is definitely unique and will give an experience that you either care for or you don't. The narration jumps in between 3 timelines - the current, the not so distant future and also another that takes place in some unknown timeline. It also changes POVs throughout the timelines giving you a rich experience to see the story unfold from different character's eyes. There's even a '2nd person' POV (that's the one with the unknown timeline) that let's you experience the circus first hand! You can almost think of it like little stories that are seemingly isolated in nature but held together by a single string. It's really almost like Pulp Fiction but think Victorian, oh and with Magic, oh and minus John Travolta and Uma Thurman. A more closer analogy would be to compare it to Great Expectations where you're not quite sure how everything fits together until the last couple of chapters. At times, certain stories seem out of place because you're not quite sure how they fit into the bigger picture while some sections just flow seamlessly. Speaking of the bigger picture, as a reader you'd get a bit lost at times because you won't see the bigger picture till the 85% mark of the book. So this ends up making the plot excruciatingly slow (the duel mentioned in the synopsis is not a quick one but one that spans over many decades!). As you can see for some, this could be a frustrating experience.So why on earth would you continue reading stories that don't seem to fit in place of a plot? The writing is really the answer (well it was for me). The writing of The Night Circus is richly imaginative with beautiful narration that just leaps off the page like rich poetry. Despite being written in 3rd person and even 2nd person, it is very introspective yet descriptive with an almost lyrical magical quality to it.Everything in this tent is white. Nothing black, not even stripes visible on the walls. A shimmering, almost blinding white. There are trees and flowers and grass surrounding twisted pebble pathways, every leaf and petal perfectly white.Secrets have power. And that power diminishes when they are shared, so they are best kept and kept well. Sharing secrets, real secrets, important ones, with even one other person, will change them. Writing them down is worse, because who can tell how many eyes might see them inscribed on paper, no matter how careful you might be with it. So it's really best to keep your secrets when you have them, for their own good, as well as yours.However if you strip away the beautiful narration and the nonlinear experience, the story itself is kinda drab and at times it doesn't make any sense (i.e. how you win the duel is so ambiguous, seriously what's stopping the magicians from working together to thy kingdom come so that nobody has to die?!). The plot is like the younger less tedious cousin of Jonathan Strange and Mr Norell however I do think that the Jonathan Strange is better thought thru and the world building there is almost flawless. There's also the issue with character motivations, some character motivations didn't make any sense at all (why on earth would you do that was my constant question). Surprisingly, the world building also doesn't hold up to tight scrutiny either. For example, if you were to ask me what sort of magic they do I couldn't tell you because the laws of magic in their world wasn't even explained properly. The nature of their duel too is also shrouded in mystery and the rules to win it even more so. The more important question of them all is, does it all pay off in the end like it did in Pulp Fiction and even Great Expectations? Honestly? I don't think so. I thought the ending was kind of weak (almost a deus ex machina) with a lot of things not explained well or not even addressed at all! It's such a waste that all the elements didn't come together as nicely as it could which is why I had rated this book a 4 star instead of a 5. Then again I've been told that this book demands a re-reading and that it may change my perception of the ending. But for now, with just a one read through my view that the ending was lacklustre still stands. Despite all its flaws, The Night Circus is a very unique and special book somehow weaving itself into my heart and never letting go. I definitely enjoyed the journey that The Night Circus has brought me along but was disappointed when I arrived at my destination. But you know, sometimes it really is about the journey and not about the destination after all. \",\n",

       " 'I can understand why people like this book, but I have a hard time seeing why people love it so much. Maybe the hype monster just killed it for me; though, I did wait over a year and a half since getting it to finally read it. But since I know so many people who rave about this one, I figured there was no way that Iâ\\x80\\x99d dislike it. And itâ\\x80\\x99s not that I hated this book by any meansâ\\x80\\x94itâ\\x80\\x99s incredibly inventive and lush and unique, and I appreciated thatâ\\x80\\x94but I definitely didnâ\\x80\\x99t find myself falling head over heels for it.My issue with this book is probably what other people do enjoy so much about it: it is incredibly descriptive. For me, itâ\\x80\\x99s almost too descriptive. Itâ\\x80\\x99s about twice as long as it had to be to tell the same story. The author spends pages and pages at times just describing the surroundings of the circus, and after a while it becomes repetitive and dull. I was desensitized to the descriptions after reading about the smells and sights and general goings-on for so much of the story. But to some people that might be incredibly delightful and enjoyable to read about. I felt that it distracted from the storyline too much.So sure, atmospherically this book is definitely a 4 or 5-star book. But when you are being told to care about these characters, especially the duel between Celia and Marco and their eventual romance (no, this isnâ\\x80\\x99t a spoiler; itâ\\x80\\x99s all in the description on the back of the book), I just couldnâ\\x80\\x99t get myself to care all that much. I did, however, really like Bailey, Poppet, and Widget. All of their chapters together were wonderful, and truth be told I wouldâ\\x80\\x99ve rather just read a book about them. I think the twins had such a unique story that they could warrant a book all about themselves.If I hadnâ\\x80\\x99t listened to the audiobookâ\\x80\\x94narrated by the fabulous Jim Daleâ\\x80\\x94alongside reading it, I probably wouldâ\\x80\\x99ve given up about halfway through. For a 512 page book, absolutely nothing that seems remotely exciting or important happens until page 328 (that is specific because I remember on that page thinking, â\\x80\\x9cFinally! Something thrilling!â\\x80\\x9d). Thatâ\\x80\\x99s 64% of the way through! Eek.But 3 stars isnâ\\x80\\x99t bad. Iâ\\x80\\x99d probably give it a 2.5 if Goodreads allowed half stars, but 2 just seems too low compared with other 2 star books Iâ\\x80\\x99ve read lately. There were moments I was completely transported by the book, but then Iâ\\x80\\x99d find myself bored and coming back to reality. I donâ\\x80\\x99t know who I would recommend this book to because if you are expecting an exciting magic duel at a thrilling night circus, you wonâ\\x80\\x99t be getting that. Know that youâ\\x80\\x99ll be reading much more about the characters, their set-up, and the circusâ\\x80\\x99s description until you reach a rather anticlimactic ending. ',\n",
       " '4 Stars!\" The circus arrives without warning. No announcements precede it, no paper notices plastered on lampposts and billboards. It is simply there, when yesterday it was not.Within these nocturnal black-and-white-striped tents awaits an utterly unique experience, a feast for the senses, where one can get lost in a maze of clouds, meander through a lush garden made of ice, stare in wonderment as the tattooed contortionist folds herself into a small glass box, and become deliciously tipsy from the scents of caramel and cinnamon that waft through the air. Welcome to Le Cirque Des Reves. \"What a great book to end 2015 with and with only 45 minutes to go! The writing was so beautiful and descriptive, to the point that I could picture every aspect of the circus mentioned, I could smell the scents described. And just wow. I wish this circus was real and that I could go spend an evening exploring it.The circus, while the real star of the story, is merely a venue for a fierce competition between two young illusionists, Celia and Marco. They have been trained since childhood to compete in a \" game \" to which they have been irrevocably bound. Unbeknownst to them, only one can be left standing at the end of this game. The circus is merely a stage for a battle of imagination, strength and will. When Celia discovers that Marco is her adversary, they begin to think of the game as a collaboration rather than a competition. They don\\'t yet know how the game must end and they fall in love. This unforeseen occurence forces their masters to intervene with dangerous consequences, not just for Celia and Marco, but for everyone involved in the circus, from the performers to the patrons.This story is very unique. I\\'ve never read anything quite like it. It starts out a bit slow, but the writing style just sucks you right in from the beginning. It is told in alternating times and from alternating POV\\'s, with everything coming together towards the end. I think it all flowed together really well, it was never confusing for me. I grew to really like a lot of the side characters, especially Poppet and Widget ( red haired twins born backstage on the opening night of the circus, who appear more and more throughout the story ).I think the only thing I didn\\'t care for was the insta-love between Marco and Celia. It seemed too sudden for me to be fully on board with it. But overall, I really liked this and am hoping for Erin Morgenstern to release some new books really soon!',\n",
       " 'The Night Circus: Erin Morgenstern\\'s Novel of Artifice\"By the pricking of my thumbs, something wicked this way comes.\"--Act IV, Scene I, Macbeth, William ShakespeareWell. That\\'s that. Done. Finished. Three Hundred Eighty Seven pages. I read every one. It was a task. It was a chore. It became drudgery. It was work. This review is cathartic in nature.Don\\'t get me wrong. I\\'m not saying I\\'m a better writer than Erin Morgenstern. I certainly could not have written The Night Circus. Although I have written a great deal, I\\'ve not attempted publication. No guts, no glory. Fear of rejection, and all that, I suppose. Not so for Ms. Morgenstern whose book was optioned by Summit Pictures, before it was completed, a fact that Ms. Morgenstern has candidly said caused her to change her own work to fit a medium for which she didn\\'t originally intend The Night Circus. Could this be the next \"Twilight\" franchise? Summit Pictures certainly must think so. And Doubleday\\'s first print run was 125,000 copies. A lot of folks have jumped on The Night Circus band wagon. I\\'ve had my spin. You can keep your \"Silver Ticket.\"Actually, the language of Morgenstern\\'s book can be achingly lovely. However, I found the plot to be a random string of vignettes pushed together between a lovely dust jacket and tied up with a pretty bow. Characterization is almost absent. Ah, the play\\'s the thing!So, here we have the tale of two rival magicians, battling through time, pitting children whom they raise in seeming social isolation to be bound to one another in a duel to the death. Mr. A.H., the man in the gray suit takes Marco from an orphanage. Hector \"Prospero\" puts up his own illegitimate daughter for a challenge in which she might die. A fine figure of a father, who in his own desire to win is willing to slice open his daughter\\'s fingers so she can learn to mend them through the power of magic--a man so cruel that he crushes her wrist with a paper weight for another exercise in repairing herself.For this challenge, the venue is Le Cirque des Reves, a mysterious operation seemingly owned by Chandresh LeFevre, aided by a curious group of comrades. They supply the money and the physical skeleton of the circus. However, it is Marco and Celia, Prospero\\'s daughter, who are the heart of the circus. It is inevitable that the two individuals, one of whom must die in the challenge, fall in love. Wouldn\\'t you know it.In a clever twist, the color palate of the circus is black and white, where everything is real. But it is not. The circus is a place for dreamers who wish to live in a world that is not black and white. It serves as a retreat from the mundane, the real, the humdrum real world of real life.Woven in intermittently we meet young Bailey who has visited the circus and fallen in love with Poppet, a red haired girl who must be as beguiling to him as that \"little red haired girl\" for whom Charlie Brown swooned. And we follow Bailey as he attempt through time to find the circus once more to find his first love. It is also a convenient device that might allow a sequel, too. Fancy that. Doubleday and Summit Pictures must be pleased. Frankly, Scarlet, I don\\'t give a damn.A multitude of readers have tried and tried to find a deeper level of meaning to Erin Morgenstern\\'s novel. After all, one of the characters is named Prospero. Ah, it must be an allusion to Shakespeare\\'s The Tempest. About as close as I can come to that is that Prospero happens to be a magician and he has a daughter. I certainly can\\'t divine the origins of The Night Circus in Ms. Morgenstern\\'s mind. Only the author can tell us that. But it takes more than a quote from The Tempest which the elfin author adroitly slips in towards the end. For this reader, I found vestiges of Something Wicked This Way Comes by Ray Bradbury, The Prestige by Christopher Priest, with a touch of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, by Roald Dahl. Unfortunately I can\\'t say Ms. Morgenstern comes close to the mastery of those predecessors, although she joins their ranks by having her novel adapted as a movie.If you simply have to find an appropriate allusion from William Shakespeare, I eschew The Tempest and opt for Macbeth:To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,To the last syllable of recorded time;And all our yesterdays have lighted foolsThe way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!Life\\'s but a walking shadow, a poor player,That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,And then is heard no more. It is a taleTold by an idiot, full of sound and fury,Signifying nothing.Macbeth Act 5, scene 5, 19â\\x80\\x9328\"Now, for the readers whose hackles are rising, thinking I\\'ve called Ms. Morgenstern an idiot, I respond, not so. Far from it. No, Ms. Morgenstern is cunning as a fox, even attending Comic-Con 2011 to promote The Night Circus before its publication by Doubleday. An artifice is:1a : clever or artful skill : ingenuity b : an ingenious device or expedient2a : an artful stratagem : trickb : false or insincere behavior http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictio...I leave it to other readers to decide how many of the above apply to The Night Circus. But, it was just not my cup of tea.',\n",

       " 'I have read and enjoyed all the Harry Potter books. In a way, I consider them my friends. The Night Circus is no Harry Potter, despite the marketing dreams of Doubleday management. It is a fantastical battle/love story, set at the turn of the 20th century, that summons the imagery and characterizations of Shakespeareâ\\x80\\x99s The Tempest. The primary thrust here is the battle. Two children are chosen as stand-ins for an ages-old competition between two mysterious and seemingly immortal wizard-types. One might see in this a contemporary commentary on the history of civilization sending young people off to die for foolish reasons. But I do not really think that was the intent. The two are Marco, plucked from an orphanage by the grey-suited man (I found myself always thinking The Man in the Yellow Hat for some reason) and Celia, the daughter of a magician stage-named Prospero. If that sounds a bit familiar it is because, in The Tempest, Prospero is the main character. Our version seems to feel a compulsion to call his daughter, Celia, by the name Miranda, the name of Prosperoâ\\x80\\x99s daughter in the elder work, but she resists. We must presume the author is winking and nodding and urging us to brush up our Shakespeare. Our Prospero, off-stage-named Hector Bowen, and the never fully-named grey-suited character have staged this contest many times before. These two think little of manipulating actual people for their dubious pleasures. The venue is to be the circus, and the rules are inscrutable. The two children are trained in the magic arts by their respective elders for their entire youth, preparing them for a competition to prove whose pet is superior. They eventually meet and fall in love, of course, which complicates things. Overall, I thought this was a pretty nifty notion. I only wish Morgenstern had paid more attention to the romance between these two and was less enamored of her own compulsion to engage in feats of literary legerdemain. I found her scenes with the two very effective. The book is rife with descriptive smoke and mirrors, a bit too much so. OK, way too much so. I cannot recall reading a book that paid quite so much obvious attention to its color palette. I know that might make it sound pretentious, but I think that works rather well here, to a point. I was reminded of the Langella Dracula production on Broadway more than a few years back. The entire stage was monochromatic, which made the red flower sitting in a vase stand out like a beacon. Ditto here. With everything portrayed in black, white, and shades between, whenever color emerges it catches the eye. It is not too hard to find the place from which this emanates. In an interview at Comic-Con in San Diegoâ\\x80¦Morgenstern, 33, who also is a painter, told USA TODAY that before she ever had characters, she visualized the colorful performers and contrasting black and white tones of the tents and circus setting. \"I paint very messy. I throw paint around,\" says Morgenstern, who now lives in Boston. \"So when I let myself do the same sort of thing with my writing, and I would just write and write and write and revise, that\\'s when I found my rhythm in writing.\" (http://www.usatoday.com/life/books/ne...) What is the coloring supposed to indicate? What is she saying here? I do not know, but it does stand out. And that is an indicator of a potential problem. If there is a technique being used so loudly that serves little clear purpose, then why is it being used?A Tarot motif also figures throughout, so those of you who are not seers or special readers, start your search engines to suss out what each of the many mentioned cards might portend. And set your search for the Marseilles deck. Morgenstern uses her tarot references to add info about her characters, and a tarot-reading seer to grease those wheels. This one is a knight. That one is a magician. Usually the references are pretty obvious, so, ultimately, with an exception here or there, the cards as indicators of character do not really add much. And raise your hands, anyone who thinks a seer might overlook something close to home.Dreams figure large â\\x80\\x93 the gigantic clock commissioned for the circus is named Wunschtraum which translates from the German to â\\x80\\x9cPipe Dream.â\\x80\\x9d The proper name of the circus, Le Cirques de Reve, translates to the â\\x80\\x9cCircus of Dreamsâ\\x80\\x9d and followers of the circus are called reveurs, or dreamers. There is a host of other references to and uses of the dreaming motif but I will not list them all here. Some of Morgensternâ\\x80\\x99s subsidiary characters were fun. The Murray twins, red-haired (Weasleyan?) spawn of big-cat tamers are fun, both possessed with powers, and both performers who, charmingly, use kittens in their act. How could you not love characters named Widget and Poppett? Poppet in particular gets a bit more stage time, and should have gotten even more. A young man named Bailey (I couldn\\'t decide if this was more for the reference to Barnum and Bailey or to George Bailey, as this pure-hearted lad was living a dull life and yearned for more) is engaging and gives us another character to root for. But again, not nearly enough time is given him. The two wizards remain mostly discorporate. Celiaâ\\x80\\x99s father is actively seeking a way out of the material world, and the man in the grey suit maintains his cipher-hood throughout. They sneak and lurk a lot but rarely seem to do any actual harm, with one obvious exception involving a knife.Morgenstern was clearly so in love with all her magic tricks that she lost focus. What is it that engages readers, makes us care? It is characters. We can certainly enjoy and appreciate beautiful descriptions and thrill at the qualities with which she imbues her world. There is a huge amount of creativity on display here. Lots of smoke and mirrors (literally), lots of bright lights, misdirections, shiny objects, many pretty pictures, and a cauldron-full of magic. I am sure that in the right hands, when this is made into a major motion picture (rights have already been bought) there will be Oscar opportunities aplenty for art directors, costume and makeup designers, and special effects pros. But I felt that there was twenty pounds of sizzle here for a two ounce steak. The emphasis was all on the tricks, the cleverness, the magic, and not nearly enough on the core love story. Morgenstern clearly can make her characters breathe. She does that here, but too infrequently to keep us from getting distracted by the sparkly things. I had the impression that she was intent on throwing into her brew-pot every idea that she could get away with. For example, it wasn\\'t enough for her to hew to her core Tempest imagery with the captured-in-a-tree piece, which certainly works in the story. She felt a need to embellish by dragging Merlin in as well. Please, enough already. We got the picture. You do not have to color it in for us. Pick your motifs, Tarot, Tempest, rings, color scheme, tree/vine imagery, time, star-crossed love, mirrors, books and reading. Go ahead, follow one, two, three, four, five. In moderation there is so much here to like, but in excess it overwhelms and detracts. Save a few tricks for the next volume, if there is to be one. Rowling paced herself and offered a useful model to follow. Morgenstern, as she does with paint, also does with words. She throws lots of stuff up there and then revises and revises. She reports that she had to do a lot of revision on this book, which makes me wonder what this looked like when it was first submitted. That it emerged in all its finery, but lacking sufficient attention to the characters represents, I expect, a problem with editing. Couldn\\'t someone have told Erin, hey, tone back the jazz and focus on the tune? Or maybe someone did and she did not comply. Canâ\\x80\\x99t say. Donâ\\x80\\x99t know. There was a chapter near the end, Stories, which was so cloying and pretentious that it was gag-inducing. Not a great way to head towards the finish line.I know the overall timbre of this review is critical. But I need to add in here that The Night Circus remains an engaging, interesting read, and I enjoyed it. My gripe is that it could have been sooooo much better with a good spell of discipline. Still this is an impressive first novel. Maybe in her next work, the bubbling talent on display here can be harnessed to concoct a more effective, more focused book. A guy can dream.PSI take issue with the bookâ\\x80\\x99s cover design, which makes it appear that the circus is a toy in the hand of a particular significant character. This is not the case. The circus venue is agreed to by the two god-like characters, and it is kept magical by a host of contributors. No single hand controls all, as the cover suggests. The UK cover uses the same black and white scheme, but eschews the single hand for silhouettes of Marco and Celia. The ARE version was better still, simplifying even more.',\n",
       " \"I honestly did not want this book to end. The Night Circus is the most whimsical, magical place I've ever discovered (even more so than Hogwarts), and I wish with all of my heart that it was real. I mean, I'd run away from home and join my life with a magical black and white circus that contains rooms of dreams, illusions, and cloud mazes. Wouldn't you?Perhaps not the most highly literary book I've read this year, but I don't care. Honestly even if this book had no plot (it does have one, no worries), I would love it. The world that Morgensten has created is beyond lovely, and I hope that she continues to write many more wonderful fairy tales. \",\n",

       " 'www.melissa413readsalot.blogspot.comI am in the minority that just liked the book and not loved it. I love the idea of a circus just appearing in the night and that you could only attend it at night. I love that it\\'s all black and white and kinds of different things go on in the individual tents. I was confused during a lot of the book, trying to figure out how certain people even pertained to the circus. Maybe I just didn\\'t get it, maybe I was just too sleepy, either way, that\\'s how it is. I very much loved different parts of the book that seemed so magical and I don\\'t mean..pull a rabbit out of your hat.. I mean the story line, how the author told it in such a way that you felt transported to another time. I would love to go to this circus! I would probably spend most of my time in the ice garden, but I love the cold sooo.... It just sounds like a magical place to be and I wish we could have read more about the things going on in the tents. I love Celia and Marco. I do not like they were pitted against each other by their masters to see who will win in the \"magic\" game. I think these two were such sweet characters even if their masters weren\\'t all that great to them. Well, Celia\\'s father was her master and he seemed pretty evil. I will leave that for you to read about. I would like to try this book again another day to see if I can get my head around the parts I just didn\\'t get. I think this book has a lot of magic inside. :)',\n",

       "[['The Night Circus is like cake. Cake without frosting. Sure, cake is good, some people will even prefer dry, plain cake all by itself, but others, such as myself, need the sugary sweetness of frosting. Some may prefer the milder whip frosting. Or maybe even caramel or candy to put the final touches on our taste buds. Either way, plain cake, no matter how moist, is not for everyone.Yes, the writing is beautiful. Beyond beautiful. It\\'s magnificent and breathtaking; the detailed scenery, the magic, the multitude of formidable descriptions of each tent inside this circus is all absolutely stunning. Furthermore, the approach taken to tell the story is excellent. We\\'ve got the journey in past and present, walking alongside the characters their whole lives, in addition, we get our very own walk inside this resplendent circus which adds a truly delightful touch to the story. Unfortunately, this is the only aspect of the book I enjoyed: The writing. While I appreciate more literary books, -- a lot of my favorites are slow paced, extremely well-read books that managed to not only tell me a story, but actually make me live it -- The Night Circus\\' strongly lethargic plot fails to let it radiate life within its beauty. Filling a book with pizzazz is simply not enough for me. I need a compelling storyline, I need fabulous characters. This is where I was left highly underwhelmed. The \"competition\" we constantly hear of is kept very vague, not really letting us in which only left me confused as to the point of the plot, not to mention let down by the absence of its \"fierceness\" that the blurb promises. Knowing that sometimes all I need is a little patience to eventually get blown away, I kept my hopes up and didn\\'t give up. I was slightly more satisfied at the end, very slightly, though I was expecting much more out of this highly praised novel. If you want to read a book to simply enjoy its outward extravagance, I can see you loving it. However, expect over 500 pages of nothing more. Strong characters can make a world of difference in books such as this. Characters I would have grown to love, to adore. Characters that would have made an impression on me emotionally. A deep investment in such characters could have made this an instant favorite. Instead what I got were colorless characters with weak personalities that I could not have been less concerned about. Maybe I was distracted by the glamor (catch-22?), maybe it was all the back and forth; whatever the reason, these characters remained characters to me. I never got to know them. I never got to feel their presence, their soul, inside this tale. Where it should have been filled with passion and devotion, sometimes misery, this was only communicated with sentences, not with the actual emotions I was expected to garner. The only character I was mildly interested in was Bailey and his parts, though not insignificant, are far and few. Your enjoyment of this book will seriously depend on what you\\'re looking for. It\\'s an exquisitely well-written book full of riches and gorgeous descriptions. If this is enough to lure you in and enchant you - I assure you you will be blown away. If an engaging plot and great characterization are also essential for you to have a great reading experience, you won\\'t find it here. Ultimately, you\\'ll either love it, or you won\\'t. Me, I need my frosting. --For more of my reviews, visit my blog at Xpresso Reads \\n',\n",

       "  \"The Night Circus was lovely and entrancing: like a Victorian-era Cirque du Soleil decided to do a circus where spectators wander from tent to tent--except that some of the performers are truly magical. The plot is deceptively simple: two ageless magicians are engaged in a competition that spans decades and several matchups. In their current matchup, Each magician is training an apprentice, who are Marco and Celia, in their different methods of magic, so that the young pair can later compete at the Night Circus in a mysterious magical duel, where the rules are unclear and the stakes are unknown. The two young players have their own agenda, but they are locked into this duel by powers beyond their control.The tale is highly atmospheric, filled with mystical, enchanting imagery: Celia's ballgown changes color to match the clothing of whomever she is closest to; a room is filled with bottles that contain scents that transport your senses to places like a Christmas evening or an ocean beach; a carousel contains magical animals that seem half-alive.I can see how this might not be everyone's cuppa tea: it's very dreamlike, it randomly jumps around in time, and it's heavier on atmosphere than plot. But it was definitely my cup. I loved the lyrical language, the mystical, beautiful imagery, and the slow-building romance, with just enough of an edge to the story to make it really interesting.When the battles are fought and won and lost, when the pirates find their treasures and the dragons eat their foes for breakfast with a nice cup of Lapsang souchong, someone needs to tell their bits of overlapping narrative. There's magic in that. It's in the listener, and for each and every ear it will be different, and it will affect them in ways they can never predict.\",\n",
       "  'In a vacant lot, on the outskirts of late, Nineteenth- Century London, a strange thing appears, like magic, numerous tall tents, black and white in color, in the middle of the night, surrounded by a fence. How it got there so suddenly, hoisted without any noise or being seen, and most unusual, no publicity ... it\\'s a circus. But not like anything, anyone has ever gazed at, the sign says performances commence, only when the sun sets, unheard of, the money they will lose. Le Cirque des Reves , ( The Circus of Dreams), has many tents of different sizes and heights, yet no main one, customers roam around and choose their own pleasures, unfeasible, for just one day\\'s viewing, the preferences you can imagine, vary widely, some attractions are outside the canvases, on the ground. Nevertheless people are intrigued, they flock in long lines, to see the newest novelty, with a large wondrous clock, at its entrance, to conquer their boredom. In the domes, are the usual, death defying acrobats, without a net, wise fortune tellers, no animals, though, a contortionist, who\\'s body does painful looking flexing and bending, almost grotesque, an illusionist, Celia Bowen, who seems as if she has real magical powers, that amaze , but that is impossible, right? A murky, cloud maze, where customers climb high above the earth, trying to find a way out, without falling, snow, and ice, too, countless mirrors showing strange images, weird birds that look genuine, flying around the tents, lights that can not actually exist, sounds and objects from who knows where? There is an unworldly aspect about this place, that people feel, but will not acknowledge, after all, it is just an ordinary circus. Naturally followers quickly develop,\"Reveurs\", who perpetually go from city to city, after the unique carnival, always searching and communicating with their fellow travelers, wearing black and white clothes, with red scarves, asking constantly, where is the Night Circus? They need the excitement, the fantasy, the delight , and get away from their dull, empty lives. Still the the main story is Celia and Marco, two rivals, in an endless, deadly, wizardry game, that the loser will not survive this contest, arranged by her father Prospero the Enchanter, (Hector Bowen), a gifted magician, maybe too much so, and Alexander, ( not his real name), \" The Man in the Grey Suit\", who raised the orphan, called now, Marco Alisdair. These selfish men with supernatural abilities, pit their children against each other, for their sick amusement. But the attractive rivals start to like each other, (love is in the air), against everything they were taught... Still one must perish ... A fairy tale for grownups, with enough magic, romance , mystery and tragedy, to satisfy every person interested in great entertainment, ultimately, the unknown is always fun to read about, from the safety of our homes ...',\n",
       "  \"THE NIGHT CIRCUS is magical realism at its most fun. The major storyline pits two young magicians (and two schools of thought) in a mysterious battle set in a traveling night circus. The circus is both the main and most interesting character. The secondary story line involves a young boy in Massachusetts who visits the circus and returns as a young man. The tertiary story line involves you, the reader, walking through the circus in the present day. The structure of the book mimics the circus where it's set: short, captivating chapters, each a feat to take your breath away. As you read from one to the next, the marvels pile up, the plot lines converge, and you're left wondering how the whole thing was even possible.There's also the sensory overload of fantastical, wildly original sights that defy physics, sweet and savory smells drifting across chapters, and the kind of perfectly delicious foods that only exists in the imagination. It left me as happily dizzied and awe-struck as a reveur.A few of my favorite things about the novel: Widget and Poppet (nicknames) are twins born in the circus. Widget's story to his sister of a wizard and a tree might be the best bedtime story I've ever read. Also, I love how Morgenstern ends so many chapters, not with a cliff hanger to get you reading on, but with a dramatic flourish that'll lead you to reflect on what's already happened.Caveats: The plot takes a little while to rev up, but this is fine considering the beautiful writing that sets the stage. There are a number of plot lines mentioned only in hints and rumors, and Morgenstern relies on these to add depth. I enjoyed that, but some people might not. All in all, this is a wonderful book I feel comfortable recommending to anyone, regardless of their reading tastes. Five stars.\",\n",
       "  'I have quite honestly never had the pleasure of reading a more beautiful book. I want to go back to the beginning and read it all over again. I just....I have no words. ',\n",
       "  'Have you ever played \"Never Have I Ever\"? Ten days ago I could ask myself several questions and walk away quite sober. Questions like...Never have I ever stalked on author two chapters into reading their book.Never have I ever created a Pinterest board...for another author\\'s book.Never have I ever ordered the special edition signed hardcopy for three easy payments of just $38 before I\\'ve even finished the eBook.Never have I ever decided to get a tattoo that\\'s \"just so totally me\" after reading another author\\'s book. Never have I ever wanted to redecorate my house to submerge myself in another author\\'s world.Suffice it to say, I\\'m quite drunk now. I\\'ve read hundreds of books, and never have I ever felt, after finishing one, that my view of the world is just a little bit prettier because of it. Until this one. Don\\'t get me wrong. I\\'ve read some great books that made me happy, and taken things away from them, loved them, and wanted to reread them. I\\'ve adored characters, settings, the authors\\' writing, but it\\'s not often I want to live inside the story. It\\'s not often that I really, really, really want it to be real. The Night Circus was more than just a story. It was an experience for me, and anyone reading it should remember that you\\'re not getting a quick, easy instant gratification read. You\\'re getting a dream. Morgenstern takes you into the circus, makes you a part of it with a handful of sporadically placed 2nd person point-of-view scenes, and colors the pictures for you. How everything looks, smells, tastes, feels, and sounds, and you find yourself wondering about the mysterious life of these performers. So the circus merely appears. Who\\'s setting it up? What does everyone do when the circus is not open? Do they even exist? Are they vulnerable to death, sickness, or outside influence? What happens if Celia or Marco just stop their battle? What\\'s the prize for winning? Most often while reading a book, I\\'ll flip to the last page if I start to feel nervous about the ending. Or I\\'ll go on Amazon and read reviews to connect, in some way, with other readers who\\'ve read it. With this book, though, I couldn\\'t bring myself to do either. I wanted to love it, and I didn\\'t want anyone else giving me reasons not to finish. The story was expertly planned, beautifully written, and Morgenstern\\'s hard work deserved my solid effort to resist the temptation of looking for spoilers. So I held back. And I was not disappointed. I\\'m glad I experienced the book unspoiled. Several times during reading I had to remind myself that this was not a romance. I kept getting aggravated that the hero and heroine weren\\'t in many scenes together at first, until I remembered that while there is a romance in it, the novel is primarily a fantasy. So be patient. The circus needs to be set up, the players put into place, and the slow burn is well worth the wait. Seeing Celia and Marco dance around each other was wonderfully agonizing. And those of you apprehensive about historicals, rest assured this book doesn\\'t focus on details of the era so much. It\\'s simply the backdrop. So yes, I loved it. I loved how the author kept revealing secrets to the end, I love that she gave us a worthy ending, I love that this made me want to be a better writer, and I really need the movie. This is exactly the type of story that should be seen put to life, whether or not it truly does the story justice. I still want to see it. Hey, I\\'d even dress up for premiere night. Maybe with a red scarf and bowler hat. I don\\'t know. Maybe.Aw, who am I kidding? I\\'m going to wear a red scarf and bowler hat tomorrow. ;) ',\n",
       "  \"This was a solidly entertaining read that really shone by the end for me. Mainly it was a historical fiction revolving around real magic that tied to a circus that only played at night, but these words do nothing to illustrate that it's really a character novel despite these very well done trappings of fantasy and historical literature.We follow Celia and Marco from their childhood and these poor kids are pitted against each other in a great magical game where only one can survive. While this could have turned into a huge fracas, it actually proceeds sedately and professionally as each child makes a career as illusionists performing real magic, until one day they discover each other.I'll be honest. I didn't really care for the book all that much until it became a romance. Odd, no? Well, that's where it took off for me, and I held on with great fear. :) The rest was great fun.Second to that, however, was the tone and the atmosphere. I understood a great love for the circus, with all the great care and tending it required, how the magic was bound to it and how things could be utterly messed up without that underlying spark. It was rather sweet and dreamy.\",\n",

       "  \"**3.5 stars**\\n\\n''A circus?'' says Lainie Burgess with a smile. ''How marvelous!''''Like a carnival?'' Mr. Barris asks, sounding mildly confused.''More than a carnival,'' Chandresh says. ''More than a circus, really, like no circus anyone has ever seen. Not a single large tent but a multitude of tents, each with a particular exhibition. No elephants or clowns. No, something more refined than that. Nothing commonplace. This will be different, this will be an utterly unique experience, a feast for the senses. [...]\\n\\n This is quite an unique book and story. The cover is captivating, that is for sure. The story itself is very original and beautifully written. It started with an intriguing ambience, a magician, known as Prospero, discovering a daugther he never thought he had, who in fact has special abilities as himself. I would even say she is even more talented. The man in question decided to embark his daughter, Celia, in a long and mysterious competiton of which very few people know about. Her opponent will be chosen by one of Prospero's powerful acquaintances. The reason I decided to read this popular novel is simple. I love competitions. As I said in my review of Panic, I love the feeling of excitement and being able to choose 'my' winner and hoping he/she will be the one who will succeed until the end. In this book, it was a bit disappointing because the competition itself is but isn't at the same time the main attraction. Not many people know about it, so it is mainly a secret the two participants are keeping. They're actually trying to understand themselves what it is actually about. The synopsis is misleading us to think that it will exciting and mysterious and maybe fun, but it isn't quite like that. It sure is mysterious but than mostly annoying because you want to learn why the two men started it and what happens and when but it is very vague.The characters are interesting. A huge problem I had is that, at the beginning, I thought Celia was in fact Isobel all the time she was hanging with Marco. It changed my way of seeing those characters and I only discovered they were not after about half of the book. I would like to say it is my only fault but I can't because it truly was confusing. When Isobel first met Marco, she was shy and had a passion for magic, of course, but so was Celia. And they both had similar if not the same age. I'd like to warn you so you won't make the same mistake: Celia and Isobel are two different person.My favorite character at the beginning was Celia because she was a bit of a rebel but Bailey fastly took her place. His admiration for Le Cirque des RÃªves was adorable and interesting. I always wanted to know what would happen this time when he goes to the circus. It mostly was through him that we witnessed shows and breathtaking illusions. It is impossible to not like his calmness and charming nature. The romance wasn't rushed but it felt to me like it was a bit, even if there was some leap of time before the characters grew fond on each other. Marco and Isobel were bonded to each other since a young age, so I guess I can understand it. I obviously didn't predict it because I thought Celia was Isobel so that she already met Marco before and was just afraid to tell him that. Well...that's not what happened of course. After all, at least it wasn't cheesy as I thought so that made it quite enjoyable.Overall, I thought this was an interesting, well-written and especially different read with unique characters. It has an alternative POV and the chapters are actually back-and-forth in time ones. It didn't bother me because it made me always wonder what will the next chapter contain. I recommend The Night Circus to teenagers and adults.Images taken form this amazing Deviant Art artist: http://fluffball264.deviantart.com/Also posted on Seeing Night Reviews\",\n",
       "  \"3ish stars.Several words that describe this book: mystifying, sensory, charming, atmospheric, dream-like, eerie, elegant, ethereal, lyrical, thought-provoking .This circus, wow. I will have dreams about this circus. I'm just as disappointed that I can't go to this circus as I am that I never got an owl inviting me to attend Hogwarts. The imagery of the circus is incredible. Words that do not describe this book: progressive, structured, plot-based.As charming as the characters are (the Murray twins in particular), I was more worried about the fate of the circus than about what happened to Marco or Celia or anyone else. I honestly wasn't that interested in the story. I didn't get that ending but wasn't invested enough to be particularly worried about it. It's very thought-provoking and (purposefully?) metaphorical. It's also very lovely but feels more like a character study (the character being the circus, of course, and by extension life itself??) than a complete novel. I understand the adoration of many readers and I truly enjoyed it even if I didn't love it.Jim Dale gives a typically fantastic audiobook performance.\",\n",

       "  \"***NO SPOILERS***I donâ\\x80\\x99t know that itâ\\x80\\x99s ever happened that Iâ\\x80\\x99ve read a book and felt the summary on its dust jacket sounded better than what I actually read (edited, June 3, 2016: Boy, Snow, Bird is now possibly a worse offender). Itâ\\x80\\x99s the other way around, usually; the summary doesnâ\\x80\\x99t do the actual story justice, or it might not even reveal that much. Not with this book. When it first hit bookstores, publishers marketed The Night Circus as â\\x80\\x9cthe next Harry Potter,â\\x80\\x9d which, every time I recall this con, makes me want to tear my pretty hardback copy into tiny pieces and light them on fire. The Night Circus promises an electrifying romance between dueling illusionists, Celia and Marco, who are fighting to the death: â\\x80\\x9cUnbeknownst to the players, this is a game in which only one can be left standing, and the circus is but the stage for a remarkable battle of imagination and will.â\\x80\\x9d Well, as it turns out, the â\\x80\\x9cduelâ\\x80\\x9d is not a battle at all; it is a series of illusions--at the circus--that each creates to impress the other over the course of more than ten years. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s no rush to conclude this â\\x80\\x9cduel,â\\x80\\x9d apparently. That lack of urgency makes for a very yawn-inducing story, particularly at the storyâ\\x80\\x99s halfway point. I was most looking forward to getting to this part of the story: â\\x80\\x9c...they innocently tumble head-first into love. A deep, passionate, and magical love that makes the lights flicker and the room grow warm whenever they so much as brush hands.â\\x80\\x9d I was sorely disappointed. Celia and Marco somehow fall in love; Morgenstern never showed the development of their love. For their first few interactions, Celia plays it cool with Marco; then the moment she doesn't play it cool is the moment Cupid hits his mark. They touch hands at one point, and something happens with the lights. That happens twice in the entire 387 pages, if that. Given how this light-flickering made it into the summary, however, youâ\\x80\\x99d think these two were causing regular brownouts; furthermore, thereâ\\x80\\x99s nothing deep or passionate about this coupleâ\\x80\\x99s love. The lone sex scene in the book is a literal bodice-ripper, and itâ\\x80\\x99s clichÃ©d and dispassionate. Morgenstern tried her damnedest, but there's zero heat between these two, no matter how warm they make the room simply by brushing hands. The Night Circus contains an extensive cast of characters who are more mysterious than they have any right to be and are very shallowly drawn. Who is Prospero, really? Who is Mr. A.H., really? Here are two intriguing characters portrayed as having possible psychopathic tendencies, yet they are nothing but shadows in the story. Marco is impossible to like at times, which I question was Morgenstern's intention. Celia is almost more noteworthy for her gowns than for her personality. Isobel is a pining, ignored, sad sack character who wastes time searching for answers in tarot cards. The list goes on. Each character can be perfectly, thoroughly summarized in a single sentence. The descriptions are excessive to the point of being purple, slowing the storyâ\\x80\\x99s momentum each and every time. Morgenstern paid extreme attention to writing detail at the expense of writing a solid, organized plot that clips along at a steady pace. Pretty, unique descriptions do not a story make; the all-important plot and three-dimensional character development must be in place before anything else. Focusing on descriptions while sacrificing plot and character development is like buying an entire houseâ\\x80\\x99s worth of furniture when you have no house to put it in. I think one of the best pieces of writing advice Iâ\\x80\\x99ve ever read after â\\x80\\x9cshow, don't tell,â\\x80\\x9d is William Faulknerâ\\x80\\x99s instruction to â\\x80\\x9ckill your darlings.â\\x80\\x9d If Morgenstern had killed her darlings, The Night Circus would be shorter by at least one-third and possibly, hopefully, have a tighter plot while being a little more fun to readâ\\x80\\x94albeit with the same one-dimensional, unknowable characters.Final verdict: Skip without reservation and read the Harry Potter series instead for true magic in book form.\",\n",
       "  \"5 beautiful stars for a breathtaking journey into a world of magic and top hats.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLike stepping into a fairy tale under a curtain of stars.â\\x80\\x9d \\n\\nThe Night Circus was the book that made me realize fantasy was the genre for me. It was the first book I read that made me realize how much I missed reading since I was a child. It will always hold a very special place in my heart. That being said... I want to be honest about what to expect if you're considering reading this book. I think the description can be a bit deceiving. While the story is breathtakingly beautiful, it is quite slow moving. It is rich in detail and every chapter feels like a work of art. The description makes it feel like this will be a fast paced and intense duel-to-the-death plot... but please be warned that this is not the case. The duel between the two magicians is very abstract and spans the course of several years. This story is meant to be savored, preferably with a serving of chocolate.I still can't help but adore this book to pieces. It is told from multiple POVs and even different times. You'll be following your POV (yes... you are a character in this book and no, I'm not joking and it is super cool..) alongside of the past and the future. Don't let it scare you- I don't think its too confusing.. and everything is building up towards the end. I can't rave enough about the characters. Celia and Marco (the two magicians who inevitably fall in love) have such an interesting dynamic. Their chemistry and curiosity for each other is off the charts. I enjoyed every scene with them together (and oh my word.. the scene where Celia leaves her shaw... helloooo goosebumps.) \\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI would have written you, myself, if I could put down in words everything I want to say to you. A sea of ink would not be enough.' 'But you built me dreams instead.â\\x80\\x9d \\n\\nDon't underestimate the side characters either. Widget and Poppet are the most adorbs characters ever. Their story (along with Bailey's) is really neat as it plays out. Not to mention- they are hysterical! And the world? Completely stunning and artistic - with a dash of steampunk awesomeness. All in all, I highly recommend this to anyone with a love for magicians, mystery, romance, historical fiction, and timepieces. I should also note that I listened to the audiobook which is narrated by Jim Dale (the same narrator from Harry Potter) - and I HIGHLY recommend it. My Blog ~ Instagram\",\n",
       "  'This review will not recap the story, but below are my general thoughts on the book. http://welovedystopianromance.blogspo...I really, really wanted to like this book. Everyone and every review (okay maybe not every,) but the majority say that this is the best book in forever. I might be in the unpopular opinion here, but I would have wanted someone to tell me that the book\\'s official summary is misleading. I was lead to believe that this was going to be non-stop action book, by this statement: \"...a fierce competition is under way-- a dual between two young magicians...\" And... It\\'s not. WHY I READ IT: I was able to win an ARC copy (one that I was extremely excited about), it has more five star reviews than not, rave reviews, and it has a confirmed film deal. (Maybe I shouldn\\'t have know that there was a film deal, because I kept thinking that there was no way for this to be seen on film, and I think w/ the lack of action, it might make people fall asleep.) Overall, the book left me with shrugged shoulders. I wouldn\\'t say I regretted reading it, but I wouldn\\'t necessarily say it was enjoyable either. WHAT I LIKED: I like the circus setting, the \"magic\", and at points I was rushing through the pages to see what was happening next. The imagery and details of the circus were beautiful, but there were somethings I just could not visualize. Maybe that\\'s the point?  WHAT I DIDN\\'T LIKE:  The book has time jumps that at first make things very confusing. It also introduces many characters at once. I found myself flipping back to see who they were and in what year I was reading. I understand it\\'s done to hold the reader\\'s interest, but it is mostly distracting. It makes the reader feel distant from the characters, at least that\\'s what it did for me. The characters they introduce are of importance, but I\\'d rather the story not focus on certain characters to give me more of the characters that mattered to me the most: Celia, Marco, Bailey, Poppet and Widget. Although I cared for these characters, I really felt like I didn\\'t connect as much as I\\'d like to have or I should have. Also, I like reading books with a great romance aspect, and it was being hyped as this super romantic book, so maybe that was the downfall? I thought this romance would be of EPIC proportions. It was sweet, but it is easily forgettable...just like the entire story. Sorry, I just don\\'t get how this is a five-star book--at all.',\n",
       "  '(Actual Rating: 3.5 stars)Erin Morgenstern\\'s debut novel, The Night Circus, is a book bound to divide book lovers into the \"loved it\" and \"hated it\" categories. Some people will adore the prose; others will despise it for being flowery and excessive. Some readers will hate the false promises the blurb on the jacket copy offers; others will still find something magical to love and admire in this novel despite the deception within the blurb. As for me, I was divided in my opinions. I mean, I really, really wanted that story the blurb promised about a \"fierce competition\" and \"a deep, passionate, and magical love.\" I still want someone to write it since, sadly, Morgenstern didn\\'t give it to me.What Morgenstern did give me, however, was a lovely novel about the passage of time surrounding a circus concocted by magical means. The circus here is not just a location: it too is a character, one that is more vibrant than many of the other characters within this story. Morgenstern succeeds at making the magic wondrous and enchanting, although those looking for the rules to the enchantments will come away disappointed. There is no rhyme or reason to the magic here: it simply is, and that is as much a strength as it is a deficit.The novel has no consistent timeline or narrative either, given that the chapters alternate among the past and present, standalone moments from the circus itself, and character viewpoints of varying importance. Although The Night Circus contains literary merit, it doesn\\'t have quite enough spark to achieve everything all its build-up promised.Le Cirque des RÃªves (The Circus of Dreams) has an uncommon inception within London in 1873: two gentlemen, one who calls himself Prospero and the other who dons a grey suit and is known as Alexander, make a wager that two pupils of theirs will undergo a magical competition. Prospero\\'s choice is his daughter, Celia, whom he has only been aware of for the past six months. Alexander, however, does not make his choice until the following January: an orphaned boy whose name Alexander does not care to know. These two children become bound together by a magical pact, but they remain unaware of each other for many years. Only once the magical circus, the chosen venue for the competition, is in its planning stages does the real game begin...\"Competition\" doesn\\'t quite fit what transpires within the circus because of the magic of Celia and Marco (the orphaned boy). There are no showdowns, no competitive scenes, no dangerous moments. Instead, the novel showcases how Celia and Marco try to one-up each other with how enchanting their various contributions to the circus can be. These enchantments, however, devolve into almost a flirtation between the two as they silently create new tents and exhibits for the sole purpose of impressing one another. It\\'s a nice idea, but it would have born more weight if both sides had been aware of each other\\'s identities sooner in the novel. Somehow, we\\'re meant to believe that, with so much secrecy abounding, these two can honestly, truly fall in love. And that is one of the greatest flaws within The Night Circus: the love story is not deep, passionate, dangerous, or even really sensical, and it makes the story weaker than it otherwise might have been.The first meaningful conversation between Celia and Marco occurs halfway through the book. Then, Morgenstern does the unthinkable: the next chapter is set three years later, and suddenly Marco is proclaiming, \"I\\'m in love with her.\" Really? Really? There needed to be some transition between the two chapters, something to bridge the gap to show that something was growing in the hearts of these two individuals now that they were both aware of one another. Instead, the love between the two is shoddy and gimmicky, the stuff of an hour-and-a-half movie rather than a nearly 400-page novel with a literary bent.Now, you must be wondering: \"Jillian, if you had such a problem with the love story, why give the novel three-and-a-half stars?\" Because the novel isn\\'t just the love story. There was plenty more for me to like in this novel: the segments about the circus\\'s various attractions, a plot line following a boy named Bailey who\\'s in love with the circus, and the inclusion of rÃªveurs (dreamers) who follow the circus around the world. Basically, the circus is the main character...and, given what I read about it, I knew that if such a place existed I would probably be in love with it too. So I couldn\\'t dislike the novel simply because the story introduced me to such an intriguing, enchanting place.All my qualms and opinions aside, The Night Circus is a charming story, but it won\\'t be for everyone simply because it\\'s not as universal as it could have been. It may be a literary smash-hit for a time, but will it be a classic read in the decades to come? I doubt it. However, if Erin Morgenstern can hone her craft a bit more, then maybe someday she really will become a household name. For now, though, The Night Circus is the debut novel that will either enchant or alienate readers. Whether you will be one or the other, that all depends on how you fare with the circus and its offerings if you give this novel a go.',\n",
       "  '\"How tempting it is to lose myself in you. To let you keep me from breaking chandeliers rather than constantly worrying about it myself.\"This story was spectacular! Although it took me an immensely long time to read, I really wanted to be able to take everything in and understand how each different story line connected. It is an incredibly detailed and descriptive novel, which I understand can definitely hinder the experience for certain readers. This was not the case with me as I live for description. I love being able to visualize so clearly that the novel is almost like a movie playing in my mind. The atmosphere was also incredible. I truly wish I could go to a circus like this, and experience everything that there is within this magical place. Erin Morgenstern really put so much effort and love into creating every detail, whether it be of The Night Circus itself, or the characters. Speaking of which, the characters are what made this book for me. They were phenomenal. Every single character was so rich, and well developed. Although these characters were magical and were out of the ordinary, they were still flawed, which makes them much more realistic, and allows the reader to understand the thought process behind certain decisions. Celia Bowen was so delicately crafted, and was an absolute treat to read about. She had a temper like no other, but used it to power herself and create her illusions rather than let it ruin her. She understood consequences and was very smart in her own ways, and never once made a decision where I thought \\'oh no, here we go\\', which in my books is definitely a plus. She was so intricate and well developed, to the point of seeing her within myself. Marco Alisdair was incredible to read about as well. He was charming, and effortless, and so incredibly fascinating. He never pretended to be more than he was, and acted as though he much more ordinary than one would assume. I really connected with him for reasons I can\\'t overly explain, most likely for his flawed nature, making him seem real. His tension with Celia was unbearable, and they truly do belong together. I think my personal favourite characters were the Murray twins, Poppet and Widget. They brought the book to life for me, with their talents, their descriptions, and especially their stories, which come to play towards the end. Even being so incredibly young throughout the novel, the oldest being sixteen, they are still so incredibly developed, and their decisions and thoughts, while also being flawed, are understandable. Their youth made the story more lighthearted, which was an added bonus. Included with them is Bailey, who was a wonderful addition, and an amazing twist. He is the epitome of every child/teenager who doesn\\'t know what to do, but given the options, none appeal to them. I loved his parts in the story, and appreciated his struggles. I can\\'t forget about Tsukiko, who spewed some of the greatest lines I\\'ve ever read in a book, and had such immense strength that inspires you, and makes you understand that strength is really found within. Herr Friedrick Thiessen, whose love for the circus was incomprehensible, and contrasted immensely with the other forms of love throughout the story. There were the supposed villains, and I say supposed because they are not really villains, but people with a flawed view on reality due to the fact that they themselves do not understand it the way mere mortals might. To not give away spoilers, I will not mention who, or why this is. As this story is mostly character driven, the plot is quite a bit slower but I do not think that this takes away from the novel whatsoever. This allows the reader to be able to immerse themselves within the story and understand each and every chapter and how they all connect in the end. I did take away half a star simply because this was quite hard to understand and grasp at certain points, and some pages or chapters I had to reread to simply get an idea of what was going on. I really did love this book overall and highly recommend it to anyone who is trying to delve into adult fantasy, as that was the case with me. I think the story will capture your attention, and the wonderful descriptions will only carry you forward. I will definitely be giving this a reread in the near future, as there are still a few things that I think I may have missed. I connected with the story and the characters, and for me that is always a priority. Overall, a fantastically flawed novel that everyone should read. 4.5/5 stars! ',\n",
       "  \"Edit: Okay I've re-read The Night Circus recently and was absolutely blown away again. I know in my review I initially gave it a 4 stars because of the lack lustre ending, the poor world building and the illogical plot points but the journey The Night Circus took me on was so intriguing and beautiful that all this didn't really matter to me at all. On a 2nd read, The Night Circus really comes to life as it shines like a beacon in the night sky. There's so much detail that I got to appreciate on my 2nd read, it was as if I had taken an entirely different journey all together. This is why I have decided to award this book a 5 stars despite all it's flaws.Sometimes it is always about the journey and not the destination. The finest of pleasures are always the unexpected onesThe Night Circus is going to be one of those books you'd either get sucked into and get totally engrossed or the kinda that gets you scratching your head and thinking 'ok can we please get on with the plot?'. Why? Cause the nonlinear storyline is definitely unique and will give an experience that you either care for or you don't. The narration jumps in between 3 timelines - the current, the not so distant future and also another that takes place in some unknown timeline. It also changes POVs throughout the timelines giving you a rich experience to see the story unfold from different character's eyes. There's even a '2nd person' POV (that's the one with the unknown timeline) that let's you experience the circus first hand! You can almost think of it like little stories that are seemingly isolated in nature but held together by a single string. It's really almost like Pulp Fiction but think Victorian, oh and with Magic, oh and minus John Travolta and Uma Thurman. A more closer analogy would be to compare it to Great Expectations where you're not quite sure how everything fits together until the last couple of chapters. At times, certain stories seem out of place because you're not quite sure how they fit into the bigger picture while some sections just flow seamlessly. Speaking of the bigger picture, as a reader you'd get a bit lost at times because you won't see the bigger picture till the 85% mark of the book. So this ends up making the plot excruciatingly slow (the duel mentioned in the synopsis is not a quick one but one that spans over many decades!). As you can see for some, this could be a frustrating experience.So why on earth would you continue reading stories that don't seem to fit in place of a plot? The writing is really the answer (well it was for me). The writing of The Night Circus is richly imaginative with beautiful narration that just leaps off the page like rich poetry. Despite being written in 3rd person and even 2nd person, it is very introspective yet descriptive with an almost lyrical magical quality to it.Everything in this tent is white. Nothing black, not even stripes visible on the walls. A shimmering, almost blinding white. There are trees and flowers and grass surrounding twisted pebble pathways, every leaf and petal perfectly white.Secrets have power. And that power diminishes when they are shared, so they are best kept and kept well. Sharing secrets, real secrets, important ones, with even one other person, will change them. Writing them down is worse, because who can tell how many eyes might see them inscribed on paper, no matter how careful you might be with it. So it's really best to keep your secrets when you have them, for their own good, as well as yours.However if you strip away the beautiful narration and the nonlinear experience, the story itself is kinda drab and at times it doesn't make any sense (i.e. how you win the duel is so ambiguous, seriously what's stopping the magicians from working together to thy kingdom come so that nobody has to die?!). The plot is like the younger less tedious cousin of Jonathan Strange and Mr Norell however I do think that the Jonathan Strange is better thought thru and the world building there is almost flawless. There's also the issue with character motivations, some character motivations didn't make any sense at all (why on earth would you do that was my constant question). Surprisingly, the world building also doesn't hold up to tight scrutiny either. For example, if you were to ask me what sort of magic they do I couldn't tell you because the laws of magic in their world wasn't even explained properly. The nature of their duel too is also shrouded in mystery and the rules to win it even more so. The more important question of them all is, does it all pay off in the end like it did in Pulp Fiction and even Great Expectations? Honestly? I don't think so. I thought the ending was kind of weak (almost a deus ex machina) with a lot of things not explained well or not even addressed at all! It's such a waste that all the elements didn't come together as nicely as it could which is why I had rated this book a 4 star instead of a 5. Then again I've been told that this book demands a re-reading and that it may change my perception of the ending. But for now, with just a one read through my view that the ending was lacklustre still stands. Despite all its flaws, The Night Circus is a very unique and special book somehow weaving itself into my heart and never letting go. I definitely enjoyed the journey that The Night Circus has brought me along but was disappointed when I arrived at my destination. But you know, sometimes it really is about the journey and not about the destination after all. \",\n",
       "  'I can understand why people like this book, but I have a hard time seeing why people love it so much. Maybe the hype monster just killed it for me; though, I did wait over a year and a half since getting it to finally read it. But since I know so many people who rave about this one, I figured there was no way that Iâ\\x80\\x99d dislike it. And itâ\\x80\\x99s not that I hated this book by any meansâ\\x80\\x94itâ\\x80\\x99s incredibly inventive and lush and unique, and I appreciated thatâ\\x80\\x94but I definitely didnâ\\x80\\x99t find myself falling head over heels for it.My issue with this book is probably what other people do enjoy so much about it: it is incredibly descriptive. For me, itâ\\x80\\x99s almost too descriptive. Itâ\\x80\\x99s about twice as long as it had to be to tell the same story. The author spends pages and pages at times just describing the surroundings of the circus, and after a while it becomes repetitive and dull. I was desensitized to the descriptions after reading about the smells and sights and general goings-on for so much of the story. But to some people that might be incredibly delightful and enjoyable to read about. I felt that it distracted from the storyline too much.So sure, atmospherically this book is definitely a 4 or 5-star book. But when you are being told to care about these characters, especially the duel between Celia and Marco and their eventual romance (no, this isnâ\\x80\\x99t a spoiler; itâ\\x80\\x99s all in the description on the back of the book), I just couldnâ\\x80\\x99t get myself to care all that much. I did, however, really like Bailey, Poppet, and Widget. All of their chapters together were wonderful, and truth be told I wouldâ\\x80\\x99ve rather just read a book about them. I think the twins had such a unique story that they could warrant a book all about themselves.If I hadnâ\\x80\\x99t listened to the audiobookâ\\x80\\x94narrated by the fabulous Jim Daleâ\\x80\\x94alongside reading it, I probably wouldâ\\x80\\x99ve given up about halfway through. For a 512 page book, absolutely nothing that seems remotely exciting or important happens until page 328 (that is specific because I remember on that page thinking, â\\x80\\x9cFinally! Something thrilling!â\\x80\\x9d). Thatâ\\x80\\x99s 64% of the way through! Eek.But 3 stars isnâ\\x80\\x99t bad. Iâ\\x80\\x99d probably give it a 2.5 if Goodreads allowed half stars, but 2 just seems too low compared with other 2 star books Iâ\\x80\\x99ve read lately. There were moments I was completely transported by the book, but then Iâ\\x80\\x99d find myself bored and coming back to reality. I donâ\\x80\\x99t know who I would recommend this book to because if you are expecting an exciting magic duel at a thrilling night circus, you wonâ\\x80\\x99t be getting that. Know that youâ\\x80\\x99ll be reading much more about the characters, their set-up, and the circusâ\\x80\\x99s description until you reach a rather anticlimactic ending. ',\n",
       "  'Look, this book is beautifully written. It\\'s about a circus. The sentences bring a magical atmosphere which is quite stunning. Also, it\\'s about a circus - it\\'s about a circus and how the circus tents are colored. Black and white. But not the average black and white, mind you! Black and white. Or is it yellow and grey? But, really, Erin Morgenstern knows how to write for sure. The plot, though? It\\'s about a circus - but not any kind of circus - it\\'s a magical circus. I know, right? Astounding. I hope you really really really want to know this circus, that you crave for it, that you can\\'t breathe until you know every fucking detail about this circus. How they perform in the circus!

       "  '4 Stars!\" The circus arrives without warning. No announcements precede it, no paper notices plastered on lampposts and billboards. It is simply there, when yesterday it was not.Within these nocturnal black-and-white-striped tents awaits an utterly unique experience, a feast for the senses, where one can get lost in a maze of clouds, meander through a lush garden made of ice, stare in wonderment as the tattooed contortionist folds herself into a small glass box, and become deliciously tipsy from the scents of caramel and cinnamon that waft through the air. Welcome to Le Cirque Des Reves. \"What a great book to end 2015 with and with only 45 minutes to go! The writing was so beautiful and descriptive, to the point that I could picture every aspect of the circus mentioned, I could smell the scents described. And just wow. I wish this circus was real and that I could go spend an evening exploring it.The circus, while the real star of the story, is merely a venue for a fierce competition between two young illusionists, Celia and Marco. They have been trained since childhood to compete in a \" game \" to which they have been irrevocably bound. Unbeknownst to them, only one can be left standing at the end of this game. The circus is merely a stage for a battle of imagination, strength and will. When Celia discovers that Marco is her adversary, they begin to think of the game as a collaboration rather than a competition. They don\\'t yet know how the game must end and they fall in love. This unforeseen occurence forces their masters to intervene with dangerous consequences, not just for Celia and Marco, but for everyone involved in the circus, from the performers to the patrons.This story is very unique. I\\'ve never read anything quite like it. It starts out a bit slow, but the writing style just sucks you right in from the beginning. It is told in alternating times and from alternating POV\\'s, with everything coming together towards the end. I think it all flowed together really well, it was never confusing for me. I grew to really like a lot of the side characters, especially Poppet and Widget ( red haired twins born backstage on the opening night of the circus, who appear more and more throughout the story ).I think the only thing I didn\\'t care for was the insta-love between Marco and Celia. It seemed too sudden for me to be fully on board with it. But overall, I really liked this and am hoping for Erin Morgenstern to release some new books really soon!',\n",
       "  'The Night Circus: Erin Morgenstern\\'s Novel of Artifice\"By the pricking of my thumbs, something wicked this way comes.\"--Act IV, Scene I, Macbeth, William ShakespeareWell. That\\'s that. Done. Finished. Three Hundred Eighty Seven pages. I read every one. It was a task. It was a chore. It became drudgery. It was work. This review is cathartic in nature.Don\\'t get me wrong. I\\'m not saying I\\'m a better writer than Erin Morgenstern. I certainly could not have written The Night Circus. Although I have written a great deal, I\\'ve not attempted publication. No guts, no glory. Fear of rejection, and all that, I suppose. Not so for Ms. Morgenstern whose book was optioned by Summit Pictures, before it was completed, a fact that Ms. Morgenstern has candidly said caused her to change her own work to fit a medium for which she didn\\'t originally intend The Night Circus. Could this be the next \"Twilight\" franchise? Summit Pictures certainly must think so. And Doubleday\\'s first print run was 125,000 copies. A lot of folks have jumped on The Night Circus band wagon. I\\'ve had my spin. You can keep your \"Silver Ticket.\"Actually, the language of Morgenstern\\'s book can be achingly lovely. However, I found the plot to be a random string of vignettes pushed together between a lovely dust jacket and tied up with a pretty bow. Characterization is almost absent. Ah, the play\\'s the thing!So, here we have the tale of two rival magicians, battling through time, pitting children whom they raise in seeming social isolation to be bound to one another in a duel to the death. Mr. A.H., the man in the gray suit takes Marco from an orphanage. Hector \"Prospero\" puts up his own illegitimate daughter for a challenge in which she might die. A fine figure of a father, who in his own desire to win is willing to slice open his daughter\\'s fingers so she can learn to mend them through the power of magic--a man so cruel that he crushes her wrist with a paper weight for another exercise in repairing herself.For this challenge, the venue is Le Cirque des Reves, a mysterious operation seemingly owned by Chandresh LeFevre, aided by a curious group of comrades. They supply the money and the physical skeleton of the circus. However, it is Marco and Celia, Prospero\\'s daughter, who are the heart of the circus. It is inevitable that the two individuals, one of whom must die in the challenge, fall in love. Wouldn\\'t you know it.In a clever twist, the color palate of the circus is black and white, where everything is real. But it is not. The circus is a place for dreamers who wish to live in a world that is not black and white. It serves as a retreat from the mundane, the real, the humdrum real world of real life.Woven in intermittently we meet young Bailey who has visited the circus and fallen in love with Poppet, a red haired girl who must be as beguiling to him as that \"little red haired girl\" for whom Charlie Brown swooned. And we follow Bailey as he attempt through time to find the circus once more to find his first love. It is also a convenient device that might allow a sequel, too. Fancy that. Doubleday and Summit Pictures must be pleased. Frankly, Scarlet, I don\\'t give a damn.A multitude of readers have tried and tried to find a deeper level of meaning to Erin Morgenstern\\'s novel. After all, one of the characters is named Prospero. Ah, it must be an allusion to Shakespeare\\'s The Tempest. About as close as I can come to that is that Prospero happens to be a magician and he has a daughter. I certainly can\\'t divine the origins of The Night Circus in Ms. Morgenstern\\'s mind. Only the author can tell us that. But it takes more than a quote from The Tempest which the elfin author adroitly slips in towards the end. For this reader, I found vestiges of Something Wicked This Way Comes by Ray Bradbury, The Prestige by Christopher Priest, with a touch of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, by Roald Dahl. Unfortunately I can\\'t say Ms. Morgenstern comes close to the mastery of those predecessors, although she joins their ranks by having her novel adapted as a movie.If you simply have to find an appropriate allusion from William Shakespeare, I eschew The Tempest and opt for Macbeth:To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,To the last syllable of recorded time;And all our yesterdays have lighted foolsThe way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!Life\\'s but a walking shadow, a poor player,That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,And then is heard no more. It is a taleTold by an idiot, full of sound and fury,Signifying nothing.Macbeth Act 5, scene 5, 19â\\x80\\x9328\"Now, for the readers whose hackles are rising, thinking I\\'ve called Ms. Morgenstern an idiot, I respond, not so. Far from it. No, Ms. Morgenstern is cunning as a fox, even attending Comic-Con 2011 to promote The Night Circus before its publication by Doubleday. An artifice is:1a : clever or artful skill : ingenuity b : an ingenious device or expedient2a : an artful stratagem : trickb : false or insincere behavior http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictio...I leave it to other readers to decide how many of the above apply to The Night Circus. But, it was just not my cup of tea.',\n",

       "  'I have read and enjoyed all the Harry Potter books. In a way, I consider them my friends. The Night Circus is no Harry Potter, despite the marketing dreams of Doubleday management. It is a fantastical battle/love story, set at the turn of the 20th century, that summons the imagery and characterizations of Shakespeareâ\\x80\\x99s The Tempest. The primary thrust here is the battle. Two children are chosen as stand-ins for an ages-old competition between two mysterious and seemingly immortal wizard-types. One might see in this a contemporary commentary on the history of civilization sending young people off to die for foolish reasons. But I do not really think that was the intent. The two are Marco, plucked from an orphanage by the grey-suited man (I found myself always thinking The Man in the Yellow Hat for some reason) and Celia, the daughter of a magician stage-named Prospero. If that sounds a bit familiar it is because, in The Tempest, Prospero is the main character. Our version seems to feel a compulsion to call his daughter, Celia, by the name Miranda, the name of Prosperoâ\\x80\\x99s daughter in the elder work, but she resists. We must presume the author is winking and nodding and urging us to brush up our Shakespeare. Our Prospero, off-stage-named Hector Bowen, and the never fully-named grey-suited character have staged this contest many times before. These two think little of manipulating actual people for their dubious pleasures. The venue is to be the circus, and the rules are inscrutable. The two children are trained in the magic arts by their respective elders for their entire youth, preparing them for a competition to prove whose pet is superior. They eventually meet and fall in love, of course, which complicates things. Overall, I thought this was a pretty nifty notion. I only wish Morgenstern had paid more attention to the romance between these two and was less enamored of her own compulsion to engage in feats of literary legerdemain. I found her scenes with the two very effective. The book is rife with descriptive smoke and mirrors, a bit too much so. OK, way too much so. I cannot recall reading a book that paid quite so much obvious attention to its color palette. I know that might make it sound pretentious, but I think that works rather well here, to a point. I was reminded of the Langella Dracula production on Broadway more than a few years back. The entire stage was monochromatic, which made the red flower sitting in a vase stand out like a beacon. Ditto here. With everything portrayed in black, white, and shades between, whenever color emerges it catches the eye. It is not too hard to find the place from which this emanates. In an interview at Comic-Con in San Diegoâ\\x80¦Morgenstern, 33, who also is a painter, told USA TODAY that before she ever had characters, she visualized the colorful performers and contrasting black and white tones of the tents and circus setting. \"I paint very messy. I throw paint around,\" says Morgenstern, who now lives in Boston. \"So when I let myself do the same sort of thing with my writing, and I would just write and write and write and revise, that\\'s when I found my rhythm in writing.\" (http://www.usatoday.com/life/books/ne...) What is the coloring supposed to indicate? What is she saying here? I do not know, but it does stand out. And that is an indicator of a potential problem. If there is a technique being used so loudly that serves little clear purpose, then why is it being used?A Tarot motif also figures throughout, so those of you who are not seers or special readers, start your search engines to suss out what each of the many mentioned cards might portend. And set your search for the Marseilles deck. Morgenstern uses her tarot references to add info about her characters, and a tarot-reading seer to grease those wheels. This one is a knight. That one is a magician. Usually the references are pretty obvious, so, ultimately, with an exception here or there, the cards as indicators of character do not really add much. And raise your hands, anyone who thinks a seer might overlook something close to home.Dreams figure large â\\x80\\x93 the gigantic clock commissioned for the circus is named Wunschtraum which translates from the German to â\\x80\\x9cPipe Dream.â\\x80\\x9d The proper name of the circus, Le Cirques de Reve, translates to the â\\x80\\x9cCircus of Dreamsâ\\x80\\x9d and followers of the circus are called reveurs, or dreamers. There is a host of other references to and uses of the dreaming motif but I will not list them all here. Some of Morgensternâ\\x80\\x99s subsidiary characters were fun. The Murray twins, red-haired (Weasleyan?) spawn of big-cat tamers are fun, both possessed with powers, and both performers who, charmingly, use kittens in their act. How could you not love characters named Widget and Poppett? Poppet in particular gets a bit more stage time, and should have gotten even more. A young man named Bailey (I couldn\\'t decide if this was more for the reference to Barnum and Bailey or to George Bailey, as this pure-hearted lad was living a dull life and yearned for more) is engaging and gives us another character to root for. But again, not nearly enough time is given him. The two wizards remain mostly discorporate. Celiaâ\\x80\\x99s father is actively seeking a way out of the material world, and the man in the grey suit maintains his cipher-hood throughout. They sneak and lurk a lot but rarely seem to do any actual harm, with one obvious exception involving a knife.Morgenstern was clearly so in love with all her magic tricks that she lost focus. What is it that engages readers, makes us care? It is characters. We can certainly enjoy and appreciate beautiful descriptions and thrill at the qualities with which she imbues her world. There is a huge amount of creativity on display here. Lots of smoke and mirrors (literally), lots of bright lights, misdirections, shiny objects, many pretty pictures, and a cauldron-full of magic. I am sure that in the right hands, when this is made into a major motion picture (rights have already been bought) there will be Oscar opportunities aplenty for art directors, costume and makeup designers, and special effects pros. But I felt that there was twenty pounds of sizzle here for a two ounce steak. The emphasis was all on the tricks, the cleverness, the magic, and not nearly enough on the core love story. Morgenstern clearly can make her characters breathe. She does that here, but too infrequently to keep us from getting distracted by the sparkly things. I had the impression that she was intent on throwing into her brew-pot every idea that she could get away with. For example, it wasn\\'t enough for her to hew to her core Tempest imagery with the captured-in-a-tree piece, which certainly works in the story. She felt a need to embellish by dragging Merlin in as well. Please, enough already. We got the picture. You do not have to color it in for us. Pick your motifs, Tarot, Tempest, rings, color scheme, tree/vine imagery, time, star-crossed love, mirrors, books and reading. Go ahead, follow one, two, three, four, five. In moderation there is so much here to like, but in excess it overwhelms and detracts. Save a few tricks for the next volume, if there is to be one. Rowling paced herself and offered a useful model to follow. Morgenstern, as she does with paint, also does with words. She throws lots of stuff up there and then revises and revises. She reports that she had to do a lot of revision on this book, which makes me wonder what this looked like when it was first submitted. That it emerged in all its finery, but lacking sufficient attention to the characters represents, I expect, a problem with editing. Couldn\\'t someone have told Erin, hey, tone back the jazz and focus on the tune? Or maybe someone did and she did not comply. Canâ\\x80\\x99t say. Donâ\\x80\\x99t know. There was a chapter near the end, Stories, which was so cloying and pretentious that it was gag-inducing. Not a great way to head towards the finish line.I know the overall timbre of this review is critical. But I need to add in here that The Night Circus remains an engaging, interesting read, and I enjoyed it. My gripe is that it could have been sooooo much better with a good spell of discipline. Still this is an impressive first novel. Maybe in her next work, the bubbling talent on display here can be harnessed to concoct a more effective, more focused book. A guy can dream.PSI take issue with the bookâ\\x80\\x99s cover design, which makes it appear that the circus is a toy in the hand of a particular significant character. This is not the case. The circus venue is agreed to by the two god-like characters, and it is kept magical by a host of contributors. No single hand controls all, as the cover suggests. The UK cover uses the same black and white scheme, but eschews the single hand for silhouettes of Marco and Celia. The ARE version was better still, simplifying even more.',\n",

The Night Circus is the most whimsical, magical place I've ever discovered (even more so than Hogwarts), and I wish with all of my heart that it was real.

Wouldn't you?Perhaps not the most highly literary book I've read this year, but I don't care. Honestly even if this book had no plot (it does have one, no worries), I would love it.

       "  'www.melissa413readsalot.blogspot.comI am in the minority that just liked the book and not loved it. I love the idea of a circus just appearing in the night and that you could only attend it at night. I love that it\\'s all black and white and kinds of different things go on in the individual tents. I was confused during a lot of the book, trying to figure out how certain people even pertained to the circus. Maybe I just didn\\'t get it, maybe I was just too sleepy, either way, that\\'s how it is. I very much loved different parts of the book that seemed so magical and I don\\'t mean..pull a rabbit out of your hat.. I mean the story line, how the author told it in such a way that you felt transported to another time. I would love to go to this circus! I would probably spend most of my time in the ice garden, but I love the cold sooo.... It just sounds like a magical place to be and I wish we could have read more about the things going on in the tents. I love Celia and Marco. I do not like they were pitted against each other by their masters to see who will win in the \"magic\" game. I think these two were such sweet characters even if their masters weren\\'t all that great to them. Well, Celia\\'s father was her master and he seemed pretty evil. I will leave that for you to read about. I would like to try this book again another day to see if I can get my head around the parts I just didn\\'t get. I think this book has a lot of magic inside. :)',\n",
