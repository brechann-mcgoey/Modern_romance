       "'The circus arrives without warning. No announcements precede it, no paper notices plastered on lampposts and billboards. It is simply there, when yesterday it was not. Within these nocturnal black-and-white striped tents awaits an utterly unique, a feast for the senses, where one can get lost in a maze of clouds, meander through a lush garden made of ice, stare in wonderment as the tattooed contortionist folds herself into a small glass box, and become deliciously tipsy from the scents of caramel and cinnamon that waft through the air. Welcome to Le Cirque des Rêves. Beyond the smoke and mirrors, however, a fierce competition is under way--a contest between two young illusionists, Celia and Marco, who have been trained since childhood to compete in a \"game\" to which they have been irrevocably bound by their mercurial masters. Unbeknownst to the players, this is a game in which only one can be left standing, and the circus is but the stage for a remarkable battle of imagination and will. As the circus travels around the world, the feats of magic gain fantastical new heights with every stop. The game is well under way and the lives of all those involved--the eccentric circus owner, the elusive contortionist, the mystical fortune-teller, and a pair of red-headed twins born backstage among them--are swept up in a wake of spells and charms. But when Celia discovers that Marco is her adversary, they begin to think of the game not as a competition but as a wonderful collaboration. With no knowledge of how the game must end, they innocently tumble headfirst into love. A deep, passionate, and magical love that makes the lights flicker and the room grow warm whenever they so much as brush hands. Their masters still pull the strings, however, and this unforeseen occurrence forces them to intervene with dangerous consequences, leaving the lives of everyone from the performers to the patrons hanging in the balance. Both playful and seductive, The Night Circus, Erin Morgenstern\\'s spell-casting debut, is a mesmerizing love story for the ages.'"

       " <span id=\"freeText5893448145973466932\" style=\"display:none\">Since the movie came out, I've found myself having to explain why Watchmen is important and interesting. Despite being the most revered comic book of all time, it never really entered the mainstream until the film. Now, people are rushing to read it in droves, but approaching Watchmen without an understanding of its history and influences means missing most of what makes it truly special.<br/><br/>The entire work is an exploration of the history and purpose of the superhero genre: how readers connect to it, and what it means philosophically. Moore stretches from fond satire to outright subversion to minute allusion, encasing the once-simple genre in layers of meaning. Even as he refines and compresses the genre, he also constantly pushes its boundaries. Watchmen is unapologetic, unflinching, and most miraculous of all, freed from the shame which binds so many comics.<br/><br/>Moore never stoops to making an entirely sympathetic character. There is no real hero, and none of the characters represents Moore's own opinions. Superhero comics are almost always built around wholly sympathetic, admirable characters. They represent what people wish they were, and they do the things normal people wish they could do.<br/><br/>It is immediately gratifying escapism, which many people attach themselves to, especially the meek who lead tedious, unfulfilled lives. Many people also do the same thing with celebrities, idolizing them and patterning their own lives on the choices those famous people make. But in this modern age of reality TV and gossip media, we know that celebrities are not ideal people.<br/><br/>Indeed, their wealth and prominence often drives them mad. While everyone else views the world from the bottom up, they view it from the top down, and this skewed perspective wreaks havoc with their morality and sense of self. Moore's superheroes represent something even beyond this celebrity. Not only are they on the top of the heap, but they are physically different from other human beings. Their superiority is not just in their heads and pocketbooks, but in their genetics.<br/><br/>They are not meant to be sympathetic, they are meant to be human. They are as flawed and conflicted as any of us, and while we may sometimes agree with them, as often, we find them distant and unstable.<br/><br/>Many people have fingered Rorschach as the 'hero' of this tale, but that is as flawed as pinning Satan as the hero of 'Paradise Lost'. Following the classic fantasy of power, Rorschach inflicts his morality on the world around him. But, since he is not an ideal, but a flawed human, we recognize that his one-man fascist revolution is unjustified.<br/><br/>We all feel that we see the world clearly, and everyone around us is somehow confused and mistaken. Often, we cannot understand how others can possibly think they way they do. Sometimes, we try to communicate, but there is often an impassable barrier between two minds: no matter how much we talk or how pure our intentions, one will never be able to convince the other.<br/><br/>We all feel the temptation to act out--if only those disagreeable people were gone, the world would be a better place. While this justification may be enough for most comic writers, Moore realizes that the other guy thinks everything would be better if we were gone. Rorschach lashes out because his ideas are too 'out there' and he is too socially insecure to convince anyone that he is right. He is unwilling to question himself, and so becomes a force of his own violent affirmation.<br/><br/>Most who sympathize with him are like him: short-sighted and desperate, unable to communicate with or understand their fellow man. Many are unwilling even to try. Rorschach becomes a satire of the super hero code, which says that as long as you call someone evil, you are justified in beating him to death. This same code is also commonly adopted as foreign policy by leaders in war, which Moore constantly reminds us of with references to real world politics.<br/><br/>The rest of the characters take on other aspects of violent morality, with varying levels of self-righteousness. Like the British government of the 1980's, which inspired Moore, or the American government of the beginning of this century, we can see that equating physical power with moral power is both flawed and dangerous. Subjugating others 'for their own good' is only a justification for leaders who feel entitled to take what they can by force.<br/><br/>The only character with the power to really change the world doesn't do so. His point of view is so drastically different from the common man that he sees that resolving such petty squabbles by force won't actually solve anything. It won't put people on the same page, and will only create more conflict and inequality. Dr. Manhattan sees man only as a tiny, nearly insignificant part of the vast complexity of the cosmos. Though he retains some of his humanity, his perspective is so remote that he sees little justification for interference, any more than you or I would crush the ants of one colony to promote the other.<br/><br/>The ending presents another example of one man trying to enforce his moral solutions upon the entire world. Not only does this subvert the role of the super hero throughout comic book history, but reflects upon the political themes touched on throughout the book. Man is already under the subjugation of men--they may not be superhuman, but still hold the lives of countless billions in their hands. It is no coincidence that Moore shows us president Nixon, a compulsive liar and paranoid delusional who ran the most powerful country in the world as he saw fit.<br/><br/>Moore's strength as a writer--even more than creating flawed, human characters--is telling many different stories, which are really the same story told in different ways, all layered over each other. Each story then comments on the others, presenting many views. His plots are deceptively complex, but since they all share themes, they flow one into the next with an effortlessness that marks Moore as a truly sophisticated writer.<br/><br/>Many readers probably read right across the top of this story, flowing smoothly from one moment to the next, and never even recognizing the bustling philosophical exploration that moves the whole thing along. The story-within-a-story 'The Black Freighter' winds itself through the whole of Watchmen, and for Moore, serves several purposes. Firstly, it is another subversion of comic book tropes: Moore is tapping into the history of the genre, when books about pirates, cowboys, spacemen, monsters, and teen love filled the racks next to the superhuman heroes before that variety was obliterated by the Comics Code (yet another authoritarian act of destruction by people who thought they were morally superior). <br/><br/>But in the world of Watchmen, there are real superheroes, and they are difficult, flawed, politically motivated, and petty. So, superhero comics are unpopular in the Watchmen world, because there, superheroes are fraught with political and moral complexity. These are not the requisite parts of an escapist romp. We don't have comic books about our politicians, after all. We may have political satire, but that's hardly escapist fun.<br/><br/>So, instead they read about pirates. Beyond referencing the history of comics, 'The Black Freighter' works intertextually with Watchmen. The themes and events of one follow the other, and the transitions between them create a continuous exploration of ideas. Moore never breaks off his story, because even superficially unrelated scenes flow from one to the other, in a continuous, multilayered, self-referential narrative.<br/><br/>I continually stand in awe of Moore's ability to connect such disparate threads. Many comic authors since have tried to do the same, but from Morrison to Ellis to Ennis, they have shown that striking that right balance is one of the hardest things an author can do. Most of Moore's followers end up with an unpalatable mish-mash instead of a carefully prepared and seasoned dish.<br/><br/>Unlike most comic authors, Moore scripted the entire layout for the artist: every panel, background object, and action. Using this absolute control, Moore stretched the comic book medium for all it was worth, filling every panel with references, allusions, and details which pointed to the fullness and complexity of his world. Moore even creates meaning with structure, so that the size, shape, and configuration of panels tell much of the story for him. <br/><br/>One of the volumes is even mirrored, so that the first page is almost identical to the last, the second page to the second last, and so on. That most readers don't even notice this is even more remarkable. That means that Moore used an extremely stylized technique so well that it didn't interfere with the story at all.<br/><br/>But therein lies the difficulty: if a reader isn't looking for it, they will probably have no idea what makes this books so original and so remarkable. This especially true if they don't know the tropes Moore is subverting, or the allusive history he calls upon to contextualize his ideas.<br/><br/>While many readers enjoy the book purely on its artistic merit, the strength of the writing, and the well-paced plot, others disregard the work when they are unable to recognize what makes it revolutionary. One might as well try to read Paradise Lost with no knowledge of the Bible, or watch Looney Toons without a familiarity with 1940's pop culture.<br/><br/>It is not a perfect work, but there is no such thing. Moore's lead heroine is unremarkable, which Moore himself has lamented. He did not feel entirely comfortable writing women at that point in his career, and the character was forced on him by the higher ups. Luckily, she's not bad enough to ruin the work, and only stands out because she lacks the depth of his other characters.<br/><br/>His politics sometimes run to the anarchic, but often this is just a satire of violence and hubris. Moore gives no easy answers in his grand reimagining. His interlocking stories present many thoughts, and many points of view. In the end, it is up to the reader to decide for himself who was right or wrong--as if anyone truly could be.<br/><br/>Moore never insults the intelligence of his readers, and so creates a work with more depth than anyone is likely to plumb even after numerous readings. Likewise, he does not want you to 'hold on for the ride', but expects that you will engage and question and try to come to terms with his work, yourself. No one is necessarily the hero or villain, and many people find themselves cowed and unsure of such an ambiguous world, just as we do with the real world.<br/><br/>Watchmen is not instructional, nor is it simply a romp. This book, like all great books, is a journey that you and the author share. The work is meant to connect us to the real world, and not to let us escape from it. This is Moore's greatest subversion of the superhero genre, and does even more than Milton to \"justify the ways of God to man\", for many men delude themselves to godhood, yet even these gods cannot escape their fundamental humanity.<br/><br/><b>\n",

       " <span id=\"freeText3424706337462951837\" style=\"display:none\">I didn't read this until last year. I saw the film about six months later. I'm a new convert still radiant with that 'just converted' glow. <br/><br/>Along with the Sandman graphic novels this is my favourite work in the medium (Zenith and Preacher get honourable mentions). Watchmen wins over all of the other candidates in ambition. This is a work of vast ambition. It doesn't deliver on every level, it isn't perfect, but it contains so much that succeeds, and comes so close to fulfilling its promises that it would be churlish to mention any failings.<br/><br/>Alan Moore is a great writer. He's not a great writer for comics, he's a great writer period, who happens to have made the graphic novel his medium. Watchmen is at times literary, funny, erudite, tragic, exciting, intriguing... it's written for intelligent grown-up readers. <br/><br/>The plot sprawls, it's convoluted, it spans generations and a large cast. What keeps it together are the deeply personal stories on various scales. Its scope was what kept it from the big screen for so long, and in truth the movie (whilst good fun and well done, I thought) is just a 2D projection of this complex multi-dimensional work. That same complexity is stopping me from doing it justice in this short review. Rather than try I'm just going to back off the grandiose praise and return to the punchline:<br/><br/>This is a fun read. It's exciting. The artwork ROCKS. It's as deep as that hole Alice fell down, but you never notice you're falling. Pick it up. Read it with pride. If someone sneers at you for reading a comic-book... hit them with it.

It made me question morality on a scale rarely seen in fiction. Indeed, when considering the characters it is incredibly hard to consider any of them truly good or truly bad. They are simply people who are convinced that they are right. <br/><br/>Take Rorschach, he follows the law to the very letter, but never stops to consider, for a single moment, that there are actually problems with the law; yes, he is violent, but his unique form of vigilante justice is an embodiment of the law’s order. He works outside the law to bring the law in a strange sort of way. Then is he not worthy of the justice he administers? Does he go too far? Is he, too, not worthy of punishment? These are hard questions to answer because there are no real answers. There is simply opinion and debate; it all depends on how you view the world. One thing remains certain though, the characters in here are so <u>devastatingly flawed. </u><br/><br/><img alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" height=\"202\" src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1445804342ra/16704388.gif\" width=\"500\"/><br/><br/><img alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1445804342ra/16704389.gif\" width=\"500\"/><br/><br/>On the other hand, you have Ozymandias who looks at the big picture. He sees the world for what it is, and tries to plan accordingly. Except, unlike Rorschach he attempts to tackle the bigger problems. To many, he is simply the villain. In reality he is as obscurely heroic as Rorschach and just as morally grey. Who has the right to sacrifice life? Who has the right to dictate people and make such a monumental decision? Well, nobody really. Yet, Ozymandias’ actions, essentially, save the world. Who can question his results? His methods are clearly debatable, though it was the only route open to him. There is simply no quantifiable right or wrong in this world; there is only neutrality and hypocrisy. <br/><br/><img alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1445804526ra/16704401.gif\" width=\"500\"/><br/><br/>This is where the self-actualised Comedian comes in. Unlike Rorschach, he is fully aware of his faults and corruptness. Unlike Ozymandias, he perceived that the world has no hope. So, what does he do? He embraces himself and indulges in his own overbearing personality. He knows what he is, and what he reflects, so he relishes in his own nature. He offers no guilt and feels no remorse: he simply doesn’t care about anything or anyone. In this he is more neutral than any other character; he isn’t in denial; he isn’t convinced he is right: he just knows that the world is, essentially, doomed. <br/><br/>So, why not enjoy it? It’s all a joke, after all. Right? <br/><br/><img alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1444841071ra/16561294.gif\" width=\"500\"/><br/><br/>There are so many conflicting and self-defeating morals in here. Never before have I read something in which so many people have been wrong, but at the same time so absolutely right. Then there is Jon, the so called God of America, the supreme Dr Manhattan. He is something else entirely. He could have changed everything. His power was practically limitless, but he barely lifted a finger until the last possible moment. And the pointing of that finger was an action that was both terrible and completely necessary. The answer became clear as to the question of his inaction: why should he bother with man? The Comedian got to him in this; he saw something in humanity that wasn’t worth saving. Rorschach saw it too, but he still tried to salvage the remnants of society through brutalising the brutalisers. Dr Manhattan, however, was simply too complex and too important to waste his time on the common man. He came through in the end though, surprisingly. Well, kind of. I thought he’d watch the world burn, but humanity did have another protector albeit one who committed necessary evils. <br/><br/>This was such a great piece of fiction; I don’t think I could ever do it justice in a review. Parts of this felt too intricate to put into words. This is a complete subversion of the entire genre and a full questioning of the flawed, and hypocritical, nature of humankind. It is a piece of work that will, simply put, never be forgotten by those that have experienced its mortifying splendour. This is the first comic book I’ve seriously considered to be great; it has become a gateway for me to explore the comic book universe that I’ve barely touched in the past. <br/><br/>So I ask you this: what comic book should I read next? Can any other comic really compare to this?<br/><br/><img alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1445804526ra/16704402.gif\" width=\"625\"/><br/></span>\n",

       " <span id=\"freeText1128203083275928311\" style=\"display:none\">I can understand why this is considered a holy tome in the field of graphic novels. The plot is complex, it’s unique, and it’s well drawn. Also, it’s got the Holy Grail of every geeky comic book fan's wetdreams – lots of cool gadgets and stuff.<br/><br/>I ain’t knocking that. Imagination abounds, and I am thoroughly impressed. I love that comic books and graphic novels create their entire world – but – BUT then again every piece of art creates it’s own world. And ALL OF THOSE OTHER ARTS MAKE EMOTIONALLY ENGAGING STORIES!<br/><br/>I get frustrated because my graphic-novel friends keep foisting these things on me. They love me, they see me as very imaginative and very supportive of their creativity, but they cannot seem to get why I go cold at graphic novels.<br/><br/>This one was thrust upon me, because I was affected by the movie The Dark Knight. I got emotionally engaged. I felt hopeless with Batman. I got a knot in my stomach when that horrible, unspeakable thing happened two-thirds of the way through the film. I was troubled by Joker’s logic, and I was frustrated with the people in the ferries. In other words, I WAS EMOTIONALLY ENGAGED!<br/><br/>A lot of these graphic novels and stuff seem to think that if they simply tickle your creative brain, they’ve succeeded. I want more – I want to laugh and cry and cheer and feel despair. I want a core of true human story. Gadgets and colors and costumes and superpowers don't make me weep or shout or ponder or giggle or sigh. Well, they make me sigh - with frustrationa nd boredom.<br/><br/>I know I sound angry at these things. I get frustrated, because I don’t think this is so hard to understand that I need emotional stimulation. And yet, my graphic-novel friends still press these books in my hand, hoping to unlock my wonder and amazement. <br/><br/>I was full of wonder and amazement at The Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay, a novel about a superhero and the super-human who spawned him. I am not above the magical, mystical, and fantastic (I love Harry Potter), but there has to be more than just gadgetry and explosions. There has to be honesty and the courage to plumb the human experience. I felt terribly at Kavalier’s struggles with violence and anti-Semitism in Eastern Europe. Sam Clay’s secrets were heart-breaking. Kavalier’s search for revenge and Sam’s search for respect were emotionally engaging. In Harry Potter, I rallied behind Mrs. Weasley's maternal drive. I loved Harry's indignance at cruelty. I thought Hermione's concern for elves was sweet, and complicated (who know they wanted to be slaves). Chabon succeeded at making me feel, and so did Rowling. Watchmen did not.<br/><br/>Watchmen is about two generations of heroes. One was human – using costumes, strength, and cunning. The next was led bys a superhuman, Dr. Manhattan – they were both human and somewhat superhuman. Then a law was passed making their work illegal, and they went underground. It’s only when someone starts bumping off the old retired heroes that a mystery starts, a mystery that asks the esoteric and totally intellectual (read: unemotional) question of why humans can be drawn to the edge of doom, and what they need to do to stop just at the edge.<br/><br/>Oh - for the people who know and love Watchmen - I felt bad for how Dr. Manhattan couldn’t have a human relationship. And I understood why Laurie got infuriated. The thrill of Laurie and Dan becoming superheroes again was honest and wonderful. But that was it – I didn’t feel the panic of the world ending (mostly because if it did happen, there’d be no story). I didn’t care for the casual use of rape as a plot point. None of the long-winded, theoretical discussion about whether humanity was worth saving had any emotional pull to me. I didn’t care. In all 413 pages, I had four honest emotional reactions. One of my reactions was anger at the tangential pirate story (don’t ask – it doesn’t have any emotional or thematic reason for being there – it was just added because someone thought it was cool). <br/><br/>Cool. There’s the problem. Cool things don’t make me feel. People can imagine and draw all the cool things in the world, and it won’t make me emotional engage. Cool things don’t make my heart race or break or pause. They leave me cold. Graphic novels are mostly cool.<br/></span>\n",

So anyhoo I read this and I can summarize this way:<br/><br/>The Movie did a great summary of the plot while formulating a story that missed the subtext of the graphic novel entirely. <br/><br/>I enjoyed both, but after reading the graphic novel, it's almost sad how the impression you take away from the movie is nothing of what Alan Moore was trying to say about the world, society or these characters. So interesting. </span>\n",

First and foremost, I want to be entertained. If the story happens to be deep, thought provoking or groundbreaking as well, that's icing on the cake. And the bottom line is that this book simply did not entertain me. It was too busy trying to be Deep and Meaningful and Teach Us A Lesson to actually do anything as lowbrow as make compelling characters the reader can identify with and have them do interesting and entertaining things.<br/><br/>While I love characters who are sucky human beings in small doses, stories where damn near everyone sucks like this one get on my nerves. I don't like reading stories filled with a bunch of irredeemable emo asshats who do shitty things to each other (and to humanity in general), and where the the themes of the story are pounded into your face with the delicacy of a sledgehammer. <br/><br/>So clearly not my cup of tea, but I'm obviously in the minority on this one.</span>\n",

Veidt's act trumps The Comedian's attempted rape of Silk Spectre and the murder of his child in the womb; it trumps Rorschach's punishment of the child killer, his torture of \"innocent\" informants, and the brutality he delivers unto anyone he happens to see committing a \"crime,\" petty or otherwise; it trumps Dr. Manhattan's personal engagement in the Vietnam War; Veidt's action even seems to trump the not-so-petty criminal activities we see perpetrated by peripheral \"criminals\" throughout <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/472331.Watchmen\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Watchmen by Alan Moore\">Watchmen</a>.<br/><br/>On the surface, we tend to condemn Veidt's action because of its scale. It's cold and precise and sterile and necessarily takes the lives of \"millions of innocent people.\" We have been indoctrinated from the youngest ages to hate this kind of killing more than any other. Our great monsters are Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot, but we somehow find it in our hearts and minds to forgive Truman's nuclear attacks on Japan because they \"saved millions of lives,\" as a young Walter Kovacs (aka Rorschach) writes in an essay about his absent father, defending Nuclear War and the Truman doctrine, albeit at an early age. And if we can forgive Truman's attack (I recognize that some people cannot forgive that attack, but many, many can), why not forgive Veidt? If we can forgive one, we must forgive the other. Sure Veidt killed more people, but he saved more too, and created a utopia out of the chaos.<br/><br/>This discrepancy in our accepted opinions is not lost on Alan Moore; in fact, it is at the core of <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/472331.Watchmen\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Watchmen by Alan Moore\">Watchmen</a>. We see it being played out in dialogue and action by characters from The Comedian to Rorschach, from Ozymandias to Dr. Manhattan, and even in the supporting folk who populate Moore's distopian future.<br/><br/>When faced with this discrepancy and pressed to discover why Veidt's actions continue to rile us, it doesn't take long to uncover a deeper root for our disdain: our need for individuality and Veidt's destruction of the freedom to make our own mistakes. <br/><br/>This realization of our anger at Veidt and why his action is \"evil\" quickly becomes the accepted meaning of Moore's story: that derailing humanity's ability to choose is the greatest wrong anyone can commit (the secular see this as a fundamental attack on our freedom, while the religious see this as our fundamental gift from God, but they tend to add anger at Veidt for playing God), and that Veidt's utopia will fail because the power of the individual is too great -- it always overcomes.<br/><br/>I disagree. <br/><br/>I don't think Moore considers Veidt's act evil so much as misguided. I am not convinced that Moore believes in good and evil at all. Throughout <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/472331.Watchmen\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Watchmen by Alan Moore\">Watchmen</a> we are led to see one man as the man who \"gets it,\" and that figure is not Rorschach. Rorschach is a guide, nothing more. Rorschach acts as an Horatio figure, guiding us through the narrative, telling us what to pay attention to, whom to believe, what to see: mostly he is trying to get us to see The Comedian. If the story is anyone's it is The Comedian's. The Comedian is the man who <i>gets it</i>, and what the amoral Comedian gets is that morality is a construct designed to help us avoid despairing at what Moore believes is the truth: humanity is violent and base; it is ignoble; it is doomed to repeat and repeat and repeat its violence because that is what humanity does best -- violence -- and everything else is playacting. Thus, Veidt's mini-Armageddon is futile, not because of our noble individuality, not because of the strength of our human spirit, but because of the strength of our animal instincts. All those lives were wasted to create a utopia that simply couldn't be.<br/><br/>And Rorschach's journal, slipped through the door of the paper and ready to be printed, is the detonation cap.<br/><br/><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/472331.Watchmen\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Watchmen by Alan Moore\">Watchmen</a> may be the most hopeless popular book printed in the last fifty years, and the most truthful. I am continually shocked by its popularity (even if only as a cult phenomenon), but then maybe it is only popular through a quirk of misunderstanding. Then again, it could be popular because people understand it better than they're willing to admit.</span>\n",

This menagerie of misfits (Nite Owl, Dr. Manhattan, the Comedian, Ozymindas, Silk Spectre...) live and breathe, that is a FACT. Also, the match-cuts are cinematic in a work that is, ironically, dubbed \"unfilmable.\" A character in a comic book tells of his fate, which matches the action that occurs in the comic book WE are reading.

And I haven't been avoiding them. But when I'm looking around the house for something to read, I forget to wander over to the comics section. So finally he just made a stack of books for me, and I started with <i>Watchmen</i>. <br/><br/>And within the first few pages I was testing his patience with questions/comments including: <br/><br/>\"Why is Rorshach the hero when he's clearly insane?\" <br/>\"None of these people are very pleasant.\" <br/>\"Why doesn't Laurie shut up?\"<br/>\"Seriously. When does Laurie shut up?\" <br/>\"Are any of these people not crazy?\" <br/>\"The Comedian is a stupid super-hero name.\" <br/>\"I'm not good at looking at the pictures for information.\" <br/>\"I like the text parts between the chapters.\" <br/><br/>He told me that if I wasn't enjoying it I should just stop (and he was probably thinking, \"If she doesn't like whining, then why doesn't she shut up?\"). But I said it wasn't that I wasn't enjoying it--well, I wasn't enjoying it, but I was appreciating it. <br/><br/>And that's my final verdict, I guess. I didn't enjoy it, exactly, because I don't think you're supposed to *enjoy* a story in which at least three-fifths of the characters are certifiably insane or at least significantly imbalanced and in which New York City becomes a body-choked charnel house. <br/><br/>But I did *appreciate* the signficance of the book, I think. I think I understand, at least academically if not viscerally, the sea change this must have represented in the tone and depth of comic books/graphic novels, and what a huge influence and touchstone this book must be. <br/><br/>But in terms of pure individual reaction? Well, it was kind of like when I finally saw <i>The French Connection</i>. There's all this build up about <i>The French Connection</i> and what a great car chase it has and how influential it was and how it marked the birth of a new type of movie anti-hero who inhabited a realistic moral grey zone, blah, blah, blah. And then when you finally see it, you've seen so many subsequent films that were influenced by it that the original seems old hat. Having seen <i>Ronin</i>, I was not blown away by the car chase in <i>The French Connection</i>. So, my reaction to <i>Watchmen</i> was colored by the fact that I have only been exposed to comic books in a post-<i>Watchmen</i> world. I didn't read comics when I was young. Everything I know about comics I've learned from Aaron Matthew Polk, and he's a huge <i>Watchmen</i> fan, so I had already absorbed the <i>Watchmen</i> worldview without ever having read the book. <br/><br/>Of course, it's good to have read it so I have a better chance of participating in or at least following along with comic geek conversations. Now I, too, can speculate on casting should a <i>\n",

I have earned my one comic book badge. It's like being a puny-colored belt of some kind in karate. <br/><br/>The point is, I appreciated the book, sort of in the same way that I might appreciate a text I was assigned to read for a class. I mean, I get <i>Great Expectations</i>, but I'm not going to read it again. (Who is crazier: Miss Havisham or Rorshach? Discuss.)</span>\n",

Someone is killing the costumed adventurers and the very dark Rorschach, our guiding Virgil into this Inferno, is trying to get to the bottom of it. <i>Watchmen</i> deals in multiple time lines, from the early days of the 40’s 50’s and 60’s when the superheroes were welcomed and appreciated, to the 70’s when laws were passed to limit their legitimacy, to the current day, the 80’s here. Moore has constructed an alternate history, one in which Nixon remains president for a third term, one in which the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan continues on in to Pakistan and threatens nuclear war with the USA. These are not exactly the nicest superheroes. Rorschach is a psycho, a bloody vigilante, fierce, damaged, with a need for vengeance that often exceeds what is absolutely necessary. The Comedian is a nihilist who has committed an unspeakable crime against one of the other superheroes, as well as plenty of crimes against the non-hero community. Doctor Manhattan, the only character with super powers, and boy o boy what super powers, may not even care about the survivability of humanity any more. <br/><br/><img alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" height=\"xxx\" src=\"http://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1451632895i/17569720.jpg\" width=\"400\"/><br/><b>Billy Crudup</b> as Doctor Manhattan - from the film<br/><br/>So what is this all about? One central concern is action versus inaction. Faced with a world approaching the brink of nuclear annihilation, is it better to act or not act? If one is to act, how far can one go to save the earth? Acting in the service of larger causes has implications. Doc Manhattan and the Comedian are shown engaging in bloody carnage in an alternate Viet Nam War. Is murder in the service of country ok? If it is ok in war, how about in preventing war? And why couldn’t Doc Manhattan use his powers to transport the enemy into contained spaces instead of obliterating them? <br/><br/><img alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" height=\"xxx\" src=\"http://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1451633052i/17569770.jpg\" width=\"400\"/> (<br/><b>The Comedian</b><br/><br/>Is Moore a fan of the right-wing or a critic? My take is the latter. On the surface we hear Rorschach droning on about the moral depravity of the city a la Travis Bickel, while practicing his own form of depravity on any who get in his way. The right-wing, rabble-rousing newspaper in the book certainly has plenty of parallels in our world. I do not think he was flattering in his view of them. Moore was writing in response, I believe, to Thatcherism, when creatures like Maggie and Reagan were seen as heroes by their fans, to the detriment of most of us. I read that Moore set <i>Watchmen</i> in an alternate reality so as not to turn off Reaganistas. Who is watching the leaders? And who is watching the watchers? <br/><br/><img alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" height=\"xxx\" src=\"http://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1451633691i/17569878.jpg\" width=\"400\"/><br/><b>Nite Owl - from the book and as portrayed by Patrick Wilson in the film</b><br/><br/>If these are the heroes we get, who needs heroes? Unlike the dominantly rose-tinted superheroes of the past, the <i>Watchmen</i> heroes are far past flawed. What actually do these characters value? Doc Manhattan struggles even with the notion of valuing the continuation of the human race. The Comedian thinks that life is a big, bloody joke, G. Gordon Liddy with a special outfit, and Rorschach sees filth everywhere. Unlike most superhero tales, this one lacks a super-villain. So the heroes have to deal with less simplistic challenges. It takes more to be a superhero than merely the ability to beat up the baddie. They have to use their brains, figure things out, struggle with very difficult moral choices. <br/><br/>One annoyance here was that I felt the females in the story tend to serve as plot devices for the development of the male characters rather than as fully realized characters in their own right.<br/><br/><img alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" height=\"x\" src=\"http://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1451634054i/17569934.jpg\" width=\"400\"/><br/><b>Silk Spectre - pen and ink, and Carly Gugino in the film</b><br/><br/><i>Watchmen</i> is part Batman, part noir detective story, part cold war crisis of nerves. It represented a sea change in the presentation of graphic heroes, from a more innocent time in which good was good and bad was bad, for the most part, to one in which the distinctions are much less clear. <i>Watchmen</i> resonates on many levels and remains, on re-reading, a powerful tale. <br/></span>\n",

Someone is killing off costumed superheroes, and the world is on the brink of nuclear war. I wasn't expecting to like this book. What, I wondered, did a comic from the late eighties have to offer me, a hip and happening girl in the oughts? You can practically see the dots in the color! I'd checked it out from the library on the advice of friends, and I'd tried to read it once before, but gave up before I got even five pages in. I still had it, though, so I gave it another chance because it's supposed to have revolutionized the superhero genre and the cover promised me it was both brilliant and peerless. Well, it pretty much is.<br/><br/>The art's not memorable, but it does the job. It caries along a compelling, multi-layered story and never gets in the way. It actually has a lot of information in it, and I loved all the details, the ads for Nostalgia perfume and Meltdown candies, the ever changing face of Rorschach, the Gunga Diner elephant, the spraypainted and sometimes incomplete \"Who watches the watchmen?\" graffiti, the newspaper headlines, and the intercuts between the pirate comic and the superhero story. Things did get a little preachy while we were on Mars and Antarctica, but I forgive Moore because he delivers such engrossing prose pieces at the end of each chapter. The excerpts from magazines, scholarly journals, Hollis Mason's autobiography, and Veidt's personal papers were actually fun to read. I normally don't like large blocks of unillustrated text in graphic novels, but these complemented the story perfectly, giving us background we wouldn't have gotten otherwise. <br/><br/>Five stars. Watchmen is a rich, clever, fully realized universe, and if you haven't read it, you really should. I hear it's peerless.</span>\n",

       " <span id=\"freeText16550911437111441541\" style=\"display:none\">I can't stop thinking about this graphic novel. It's not something I'd usually like- ultra-violent with a very dark vision of humanity- but there is something incredibly compelling about it.<br/><br/>It starts with a murder. <i>Watchmen</i> is the story of a group of super heroes who don't fight crime anymore because vigilantism was outlawed. Among the many costumed regular heroes (The Comedian, Rorschach, Nite Owl), there is an actual superhero, Dr. Manhattan, who suffered a freak radiation accident and was changed, permanently. He perceives time as happening all at once and can manipulate matter in multiple dimensions. Each of the heroes has a story, some are very sad, and all of them are upset as one of their own has just been killed. Can they figure out who the murderer is before he/she strikes again?<br/><br/>My favorite character out of the bunch is Dr. Manhattan. <i>\"We gaze continually at the world and it grows dull in our perceptions. Yet seen from another's vantage point, as if new, it may still take the breath away.\"</i> pg 27, Chapter XI. He's nearly godlike in his capabilities but that makes it practically impossible for anyone to understand him.<br/><br/>My husband's favorite is Rorschach, which I could understand, but he was far too violent for me to truly appreciate the character. I feel like there's an underlying importance to that character though, something that I couldn't quite grasp...I tried thinking about Rorschach as a rorschach blot for the <i>Watchmen</i> and it nearly broke my brain. <a class=\"jsShowSpoiler spoilerAction\">(view spoiler)</a><span class=\"spoilerContainer\" style=\"display: none\">[It's as if how you perceive this character says more about you than the story itself. Normal man, horrific upbringing, violent tendancies, won't quit killing evil people even when being a super hero is outlawed, won't give up even when the main villain of the story has made it clear that he's won. I cheer for the man, but I wouldn't want to be anywhere near him. <a class=\"jsHideSpoiler spoilerAction\">(hide spoiler)</a>]</span><br/><br/>And the comic within the comic? Fascinating. <a class=\"jsShowSpoiler spoilerAction\">(view spoiler)</a><span class=\"spoilerContainer\" style=\"display: none\">[A marooned sailer tries desperately to return to his family to save them from a pirate ship, but along the way, he becomes the monster that he feared. Exactly like the Watchmen. <a class=\"jsHideSpoiler spoilerAction\">(hide spoiler)</a>]</span><br/><br/>The <i>Watchmen</i> is more than a superhero story: it's an examination of power both physical and in the heart. It's a criticism of government, the media, and art used to manipulate others. It looks at gender roles, rape, and sexual preferences and predilections. It asks: why would a person dress up and create an alter ego in the first place? And, beyond all that, it is a mystery and a love story. There's a lot to enjoy in here if you can get past the blood, gore, and soul crushing darkness. Recommended for an adult audience only.<br/><br/>A similar comic, in my mind, is <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6465707.The_Walking_Dead__Compendium_1\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"The Walking Dead, Compendium 1 by Robert Kirkman\">The Walking Dead, Compendium 1</a> by <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/12425.Robert_Kirkman\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Robert Kirkman\">Robert Kirkman</a>.

       " <span id=\"freeText4000675448413214196\" style=\"display:none\">It’s been fairly said a hundred times in the 27 years since its publication that writer and artist Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons respectively have created something immortal which then influenced other works and changed the comics medium forever. <i>Watchmen</i> also won the Hugo award in 1988 and was the only graphic novel to make it to Time magazine’s 100 Greatest Books 2005 list. So why the enduring legacy?<br/><br/>Like any other kid, I’ve loved superheroes for as long as I could remember. I consider Batman a childhood hero as much as the great detective Sherlock Holmes was. I never realized or truly appreciated the extent of my hero worship until I first encountered <i>Batman: The Animated Series</i> when I was thirteen. Before that, I was eight years old when I first watched X-Men as a Sunday cartoon but it was nothing compared to the poetry that is BTAS. I became drawn to the darker side of superheroes since then but I still didn’t know what the darker side really means until 2005 when the second installment of Christopher Nolan’s Batman franchise <i>The Dark Knight</i> hit the theaters. I didn’t know that it was an allegory of the Bush administration’s War on Terror but I did understand that Batman’s vigilantism is not always as heroic and anyone who would put on a mask and fight crime has some serious issues to deal with. This was why the superhero action flicks that came after TDK never appealed to me anymore and it was only when in 2010 I watched the Director’s Cut of Zack Snyder’s <i>Watchmen</i> and I finally realized what it was about the superhero that I wanted to unmask. I got my copy of the original graphic novel two months after and I’ve been engrossed with reading it so much that I decided to record my thoughts in a podcast and liked what I was doing so I went on for the next chapters, given that I also received support from some people in the Watchmen fandom I became a part of. <br/><br/>I do feel that it is an important work not because it was the first attempt to deconstruct the superhero genre although that partly drives the legacy of <i>Watchmen</i>, but rather it has something more to do with Watchmen’s depth, complexity and artistic understanding of a medium like comic books which has been on the unflattering receiving end of the majority. <i>Watchmen</i> made readers and writers of the medium to aspire for something greater. It never belittled its audience and it embraced the conventions of the medium as well as it satirized it. It was a social commentary masquerading as entertainment. It was a psychological examination of characters who are supposed to represent and parody the superhero archetypes. It’s a celebration of the American spirit and creative achievement. It’s a story with a material that lets you discuss it with other people and encourages even scholarly discourses. <i>Watchmen</i> as a definitive work challenged moral philosophies through the symbol, meaning and message of the superhero. <br/><br/><i>Watchmen</i> deconstructed and parodied both superhero and villain archetypes. Superman is examined through Dr. Manhattan, Batman’s duality is explored in Nite Owl and Rorschach, The Comedian is the less than desirable version of Captain America with a twisted sense of humor and chaos similar to that of the Joker. Silk Spectre II demonstrated that there is more to the femme fatale persona of female masked adventurers. And Ozymandias personally reminded me of Superman’s arch-nemesis Lex Luthor. What Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons intended was to reinvent characters from the Charlton comics series but instead came up with these characters that we know and love based on the genre’s archetypes.<br/><br/><i>Watchmen</i> has twelve chapters which represented the metaphorical format of twelve minutes to midnight from the Doomsday clock during the Cold War. It also breathlessly transported us in an alternate American history where superheroes co-existed with us and have therefore influenced the course of events, lifestyles and technological discoveries. Vigilantes and masked avengers became celebrities during the mid-forties and outlaws during the seventies. We are taken into the heart of things through the paranoid but often also reasonable ramblings of Rorschach who investigates the murder of a retired government-sponsored hero named Edward Blake and instead uncovers an intricate web of conspiracies perpetuated by a self-made billionaire and self-proclaimed smartest man in the world, Adrian Veidt. <br/><br/>There are sideline adventures and dramatic storylines where a demigod named Dr. Manhattan leaves the planet he no longer wishes to be entangled with, where a woman named Laurie Juspeczyk once and for all throws away the shoes her mother has forced her to fill for years, where Daniel Dreiberg a miserable man who overcomes his impotency by embracing the life he had always wanted regardless of rules and where a modest newspaper vendor does something heroic for a high school kid he barely knew but whom he shares a common name with. These are the stories that touched us deeply, felt through unforgettable characters who took us on a journey that became very personal and often transcendental.<br/><br/>I think <i>Watchmen</i> for me is a celebration of the superhero genre indeed and that in reading this graphic novel, it made me appreciate superheroes for everything they’re supposed to stand for and reflect and what their value and myth mean in the societies we live in; how they sometimes parody our lives, whether it’s the simple act of putting on a mask and a costume to fight crime or by exposing and dismantling parts of our psyche and civilization through showcasing the consequences of vigilantism, of living a double life and of placing the fate of an entire race on certain people who are burdened with their personal motivations. But ordinary people with their flaws and compensations and problems—they’re the ones that we must connect with, not these ideals we created and placed on superheroes. <br/><br/><b>RECOMMENDED: 10/10</b><br/><i>* For three years now I’ve been so deeply engrossed in this work and I’m not afraid to say that it made my life better, giving me new perspective about the world in a way only a beautiful literature can do. </i></span>\n",

How to review the unreviewable? <br/><br/>Iconic. Classic. Nostalgic. Reinvented comics and the anti-hero. Redefined meta-fiction. If Alan Moore is known for only one thing, it's Watchmen. <br/><br/>It's pre-apocalyptic alternate 1985 America. The Cold War. Gay rights. Women's rights. And costumed heroes are outlawed. Suddenly these retired heroes are being killed off, and it's left to the anti-hero Rorschach and depressive Nite Owl to discover the mysterious truth!<br/><br/>What's funny is that Watchmen is a one trick pony, but a really fucking incredible pony. It's drama, pure and simple, gritty and dark and stylistic. With underlying allegory, sociopolitical commentary, suspense, mystery, and hardcore violence. Seriously, if there's one thing Watchmen isn't it's funny. But that's okay. <br/><br/>I really do like Alan Moore's writing here. This is my second read since 2009, and even seven years didn't dull my enjoyment. It's a slow burn, but it's like sci-fi soup, rich and complex and weird, with plenty of things to mentally chew. Especially as most of the story takes place in New York. The city, the world, and its inhabitants are unique and dynamic. We see far beyond just Nite Owl and Rorschach, Dr. Manhattan and Silk Spectre. We see the newspaper vendor and comic book kid, both named Bernie. We see the psychiatrist and his wife. We see the cabbie and her girlfriend. Moore populates his hero world with incredible characters. <br/><br/>Dave Gibbons is awesome. I'm biased because I'm so young. I have no idea what comics were in the 1980s. I've heard that Gibbons' style isn't especially striking for the time, but his colors and cinematic vision are, however. I've said it before, colors make or break a comic book. And these really are incredible. What strikes me about these colors is their arbitrariness. They're just weird. But they're eerie and beautiful, and lend to the story's alternative world. <br/><br/>So there you have it. Watchmen is badass. Alan Moore isn't a god but you can't deny his impression. And Dave Gibbons absolutely made this book and made these characters and this world come alive. <br/><br/><i>A short note on the Deluxe Edition...</i> This sucks. I bought it several years ago before I knew what to look for in editions and this is my first time reading it. The black and yellow dust jacket looks fine, but it wraps a cheap cover that damages easily. The paper is terrible. Thin, low gloss pulp that's almost newsprint. The heavily glued binding is crazy tight and refuses to lay flat, with moderate gutter loss. And there's so much glue that two pages stuck together and tore! How's that for deluxe? The extras were okay, mostly light pencil sketches, not really worth paying more than the paperback. If you love Watchmen and want a proper edition, I would suggest the Absolute, which I will be getting to replace this.</span>\n",

Bold lines curving around supple limbs, a palate of strong colors suffusing every empty space with black, yellow, red arcing in a heroic spray of vitality.

You remember your childhood, filled with dreams and hobbies and racing through the world with bright eyes and an eager mind. <br/><br/>The poster is in an alleyway. It is filthy, and dark, and cold, and there is a sour smell of urine mixed with mustard and pot blowing across your face. You can see the poster hung by a door by way of the guttering light of a neon sign, 'LIQUOR' buzzing faintly into the night. The superhero's bold and strong design is marred with the bulges of its brick framework, poster plastered in wedges that have managed to survive the brutal onslaught of the elements for many years. Holes poke through where the survival was incomplete, including an unfortunate rip that reduces the right eye to a gaping maw, edges fluttering faintly as the acrid wind continues to blow. <br/><br/>You turn. There is something in the alleyway you can't quite see, a limp bundle nearly invisible to the eye, save for the glitter of something that manages to catch a little light from the decrepit sign. You step closer. The glitter is from a cheap metal bracelet, hanging from the slim ankle of a leg that even in the flaky light shows evidence of abuse, worsening as skin approaches skirt. You crouch, get a good look at her face. She can't be more than fourteen. Then you see the hole in her forehead, partially obscured by her bangs that frame a face still in the flush of youth, save for a gout of blood that is sluggishly pooling on her shoulder. <br/><br/>You stand, hastening to leave the alleyway with its silent sentinels. It's a tragic shame, what happened to her. But you can't afford to be caught with her. Would cause too much trouble. Besides, you're no superhero or crime fighter, someone capable of punishing the culpable. You have a normal job, a normal family, a normal life. There's no time to care about the misfortunes of complete strangers. Let the stronger ones, the smarter ones, the richer ones worry about all of humanity. Your mind whispers, what if they are the ones responsible? Who will keep them in line? But you squash it. You have enough problems of your own.<br/><br/>Making your way home takes you by a church in the midst of a mass, choir voices ringing out in a hallelujah that compels you to pause and listen for a small while. The lights, shining through slender archways, rising with the climbing voices to noble towers that frame the night sky so much more elegantly than their crude apartment complex neighbors. A single choir member reaches a single note so pure, you momentarily forget whatever concerns you were dwelling on, and marvel on 'the music of the spheres', a phrase you haven't heard since your days at high school. <br/><br/>Such beauty, not more than five blocks away from the scene of such an ugly crime. Such small, violent, petty concerns, framed alongside an ancient society concerned with adulation of grand cosmic forces. A brutal squirming of the physical, and the stately worship of surmounting it. Survival, squaring off with the reason to survive.<br/><br/>And humanity is responsible for both.<br/><br/>You hurry home. It's cold, and your thoughts are troubling. Better to drink and sleep it off. Tomorrow's another day.</span>\n",

       " <span id=\"freeText10562184400539475863\" style=\"display:none\">Two realizations occurred to me while reading this book:<br/><br/>1. The movie version, while long as hell, is actually really well done and accurate. And by \"accurate\" I of course mean \"basically a frame-by-frame reproduction of the graphic novel.\" Not necessarily a bad thing, although they do change some details of the ending a little. I was okay with both versions, though. I think I still prefer the graphic novel, mostly because when I read it I don't have to deal with the horribly miscast Malin Ackerman. I knew she was ruining Silk Spectre II before I even read the original story. Every other character is perfectly cast, though, so it's mostly okay.<br/><br/>2. The movie <i>The Incredibles</i> is <i>Watchmen</i> for kids. For example, in excerpts from his book that are spaced throughout the graphic novel, a former superhero discusses his costume-making process: \"I experimented with a cloak, remembering how the Shadow would use his cloak to misguide enemy bullets...In practice, however, I found it too unwieldy. I was always tripping over it or getting it caught in things, and so I abandoned it for an outfit that was as streamlined as I could make it.\" <br/>Or, as Edna Mode would say, \"NO CAPES!\" <br/><br/>Movie references aside, I really liked all the technical details about being a superhero I'd never considered before (for example, how do they keep those little masks stuck to their faces? Spirit gum.), as well as the psychology of the superhero. That's really the whole point of <i>Watchmen</i>: the kind of people who are willing to put on a costume and fight crime may not be the kind of people you actually <i>want</i> to have running around beating up criminals. Case in point: Rorschach. I...I don't even have words to describe this character. The movie didn't even really do him justice. <br/><br/>In conclusion, amazing and thought-provoking and everyone should read it, even if you've never picked up a graphic novel before. <br/><br/>\"Yes, we were crazy, we were kinky, we were Nazis, all those things that people say. We were also doing something because we believed in it. We were attempting, through our personal efforts, to make our country a safer and better place to live in. Individually, working on our separate patches of turf, we did too much good in our respective communities to be written off as mere aberration, whether social or sexual or psychological. <br/>It was only when we got together that our problems really started....Dressing up in costume takes a very extreme personality, and the chances of eight such personalities getting along together were about seventy-eleven million to one against.\" </span>\n",

It was an in-depth, gritty, dark, mostly sad look at an alternate world a lot like ours. The \"superheroes\" were just dysfunctional guys (and gals) running around in tights. None of them seemed very heroic when it came down to it, and the only one of them with actual superpowers didn't care about anything at all. I still don't know if I like it, and it certainly wasn't enjoyable to read. Most of the time it made me feel slightly nausious, but I think that was what the writer and artist were going for. I am, however, glad that I read it. It was different and I can see why this thing has been talked about so much for all of these years.

It challenged, deconstructed, and redefined the superhero story to the point that it’s hard to imagine any comic book writer not being fully cognizant of Alan Moore and Dave Gibbon’s Watchmen when they put pen to paper (or finger to keyboard). Despite it coming out almost 30 years ago, it’s remained continuously in print with its iconic yellow smiley face with a drop of blood. Most fans consider it the greatest graphic novel ever written, and Time Magazine named it one of the 100 best English-language novels. I’m not an expert in comics or graphic novels, but I wouldn’t disagree. In fact, until recently it was the only graphic novel (other than Frank Miller’s SIN CITY series) I’d read in the past 25 years despite a life-long love of SFF.<br/><br/>I think Watchmen addresses a lot of the reasons WHY I wasn’t interested in comics all that time. They’re right next to SFF books in the bookstore, and they feature stories that are mostly fantastic in nature. Not only that, but they having amazing cover artwork that really catches the eye. So what’s the problem? I guess my memories of comics are from the mid-1980s, and back then when I read G.I. JOE and TRANSFORMERS, I’m pretty sure I was just brain-washed by Hasbro. The stories weren’t great and neither was the artwork. I was never really interested in SUPERMAN, BATMAN, THE AVENGERS, X-MEN, etc. The stories seemed too simplistic (just a preconception – I didn’t actually read them) and filled with KAPOWS and THWACKTS ala Adam West’s classic Batman TV series. Once I was actively reading 500-page SFF novels as a teenager, I simply assumed that comics COULD NOT achieve the same depth of story and character that books can. <br/><br/>However, over the last two decades Hollywood has discovered what an absolute treasure trove comic book superheroes are. They’re ready-made franchises with thousands of episodes and story-arcs, iconic characters that everyone knows, and tons of product tie-in potential. It’s been a bonanza for MARVEL and DC, the two industry heavy-hitters. And most people now know who Frank Miller and Stan Lee are. One of the biggest trends of more recent years has been the increasingly dark and complicated nature of super heroes. You need look no further that the original Tim Burton versions of Batman from the 1990s to the incredibly dark vision of Christopher Nolan’s DARK KNIGHT series.<br/><br/>It’s very likely that Watchmen (and Frank Miller’s DARK KNIGHT reinterpretation) deserve a lot of credit for that trend toward dark, complicated, and twisted superheroes, to the point where the term “hero” comes into question. In Watchmen there may be a lot of characters dressed in costume, but you’d be hard-pressed to identify the “superheroes” among them. In fact, it’s fair to question whether they are “super” at all. The characters of Watchmen are all attracted to the idea of the “superhero”, that person with extraordinary abilities who uses them to fight crime and injustice. And while there is certainly one character (Doc Manhattan) who has incredible powers far beyond most superheroes, he is distant and uninvolved in human affairs despite his human origins and love interests. <br/><br/>Watchmen asks the disarmingly simple question, “What is a superhero, and why would anyone want to be one?” I mean, they’re dressing up in tights and spandex and going around beating up criminals. That’s not a “normal” career. In fact, how do superheroes earn income? Do they pay taxes? Do they take those costumes to a dry-cleaners or hand-wash only? The more you think about it, the more ridiculous it sounds. We all know that crime pays, but what about crime-fighting? You don’t get much besides the keys to the city, a handshake from the mayor, and the thankful smiles of a grateful citizenry. So wanting to be a superhero is something internally-driven. Even then, why? The thrill of anonymity, perhaps, or the desire to become someone more exciting than the everyday prosaic middle-aged tax accountant with the nice house, pretty wife, 2 cars, golf membership, kids and a dog. Then again, maybe you really have a grudge against crime and want to champion the weak. You might have been the victim of a terrible crime and vowed to dedicate your life to protecting people from such a fate. Or maybe it just seemed like a cool idea and you didn’t have any other particular plans.<br/><br/>There are so many themes explored in Watchmen that you could easily teach a college lit course about it, and there are in fact such classes, though I was never fortunate enough to take one. Our very own FanLit comic expert Brad tells me he has taught this text many times to many of his students. It’s guaranteed to produce a lot of amazing discussions, I’m sure. It’s also clearly intended to be read multiple times, and I’ve read it twice. So to avoid driving myself insane trying to cover every aspect of this multi-layered work of art, I’m going to stick to the central theme of “what is a superhero, and why be one?” One of the great aspects about Watchmen is that it is a deeply moral work that concerns itself with justice, free-will, evil, despotism, hubris, and yet it never spells out its agenda, or cheapens its characters by making them mouth-pieces for the author’s pet ideas. Of course each character explores aspects of the superhero concept, but none of them fit that Golden Age stereotype with bulging muscles, a square jaw and deep voice, and an untiring drive to fight crime.<br/><br/>Below is a basic synopsis of the main characters of Watchmen. There is an earlier set of superheroes that arose in the 1940s and 1950s in this alternate reality, but I won’t even attempt to describe them. They form the basic conceptual framework for superheroes, but I’m most interested in the characters who drive the main story arc in the 1980s:<br/>THE COMEDIAN (Eddie Blake): This guy is a big, cynical and amoral thug. He revels in conflict and violence – although ostensibly falling under the “superhero” rubric, he quickly finds he has no problems taking down Latin American dictators as a government operative. He also takes great pleasure in killing “badguys”, which in Vietnam basically meant everyone opposed to US forces. Machine guns, flame throwers, fists &amp; kicks, it’s all good to the Comedian. Because to him life is one big, ironic joke. The joke being that you’re a sucker if you believe there is any justice or purpose in our lives. The strong take what they want, and the weak don’t. Who would you rather be? His philosophical differences with Nite Owl are fascinating, and his emotional dealings with both iterations of Silk Spectre show his best and worst sides. <br/><br/>RORSHACH (Walter Kovacs): Rorshach sees the world in black and white, a simple dualism of good and evil. He was bullied as a child, railed against his prostitute mother, and developed an intense and smoldering hatred for the worst aspects of humanity. This hatred is so all-consuming that it leaves little room for sympathy for the common man. As a form of self-validation, Rorshach spends all his time hunting down criminals of the streets, beating and killing them without mercy. Those that hurt children in particular draw his ire. Where he struggles is finding room for anything that doesn’t fit his ultra-narrow worldview. There are no grays in his moral universe, only black and white shifting but never mixing, like his mask. He is an angel of vengeance, a vigilante with the noblest intentions. But is he a hero, or a vigilante? Does purity of intent and purpose justify his ruthless killing? Readers who sympathize with Rorshach should examine their politics in other areas as well. Maybe he is right, maybe humanity is unworthy, but what an awful way to live each day. <br/><br/>NITE OWL (Daniel Dreiberg): The modern-day Nite Owl is actually the second to wear the costume. Dan Dreiberg inherited a lot of money from his banker father, and has a deep love for flying machines and animals. One suspects he wishes he could just watch owls all day and fly with them. He was the crime-fighting sidekick of Rorshach and the Comedian, but has hung up the wings to do…nothing. His life seems fairly pointless after quitting crime-fighting. He tinkers in his place alone, only reliving the old times with weekly beer sessions with the senior Nite Owl. His characters is pretty wimpy until he catches Silk Spectre on the rebound from Doc Manhattan, at which points things spice up a bit. Although he is perhaps the most normal of the Watchmen, he is hardly heroic. <br/><br/>OZYMANDIAS (Adrian Veidt): After retiring from crime-fighting, Adrian has become an extremely-successful businessman who is also “the smartest man in the world”. He is incredibly athletic and handsome, skilled at hand-to-hand combat, and markets his own training program. In other words, he’s that guy from high school everyone hates and envies. He runs Veidt Enterprises, and is something of an unholy combination of Tony Starks (rich, charismatic, brilliant) and Donald Trump (complete egomaniac, superiority complex). Adrian’s biggest problem is that he is so superior to the average man that he can’t help looking down on him. This causes him to hatch an elaborate and evil master-plan that any super villain would be proud of.<br/><br/>SILK SPECTRE (Laurie Juspeczyk): Laurie is the weakest character in the group, and probably Moore’s least impressive creation. It seems clear that he had trouble coming up with a viable female superhero. One wonders what would happen if he had instead tried a Harley Quinn-type villain with some charm. Laurie’s mom was Sally Jupiter, the original Silk Spectre, who had some ties to the Comedian in the past. Laurie grew up idolizing her superhero mom, and so has followed in her footsteps. However, her main purpose seems to be the love interest for Doc Manhattan, his last emotional connection to humanity. <br/><br/>DOC MANHATTAN (Jon Osterman): He is by far the most interesting of Moore’s creations. Doc was a promising scientist studying particle physics. When an experiment goes terribly wrong, he is initially atomized before finding a way to reconstruct himself, atom by atom, and become this all-powerful blue man-figure with a great physique and disdain for clothing. He still stays with his girlfriend at the time, but the US military increasingly uses him for geopolitical power politics, particularly to maintain a precarious edge over the USSR in an alternate version of the Cold War (perhaps the only plot element that feels overly 1980s). The stresses of being used for his powers (including the Vietnam War) despite his growing disillusionment with the petty conflicts of humanity eventually spoils his relationship, but instead he shacks up with the Laurie, the younger iteration of Silk Spectre. She too suffers from his clumsy inability to understand the emotional needs of another human being, let alone a lover. <br/><br/>We see Doc Manhattan wield almost unlimited powers over matter, creating and destroying at will. And yet when he gets completely fed up with the tawdry squabbles of mankind, he ditches Earth and heads to Mars for some R&amp;R, meditating and creating a fantastic geodesic artifact to occupy himself. What we see in him is a far more realistic portrayal of what an all-powerful being is likely to behave like. Unlike Jehovah of the Old Testament, who is constantly punishing humanity for every little transgression like a petulant child smashing his toys, Doc Manhattan can’t be bothered with people. Seriously, why would you when the world of tachyons and quarks are so much more interesting. <br/><br/>The other fascinating thing about Doc is that he lives in a quantum universe, so he experiences time as a continuum, seeing past, present, and future simultaneously. Moore really nails the mechanics of avoiding time paradoxes: my favorite pet peeve involves that hairy old chestnut “going back to change things”. It’s very simple, really: you can’t change anything because time already exists and is fixed. You can look up and down the line, but don’t think you can change it. This means that Doc knows the future but can’t do anything about it. That makes it pretty frustrating when Laurie tries to have conversations with him. It also makes the universe a very deterministic place and discounts the concept of free will. Even if we are free to make our choices, they have already been made in the quantum universe.<br/><br/>So the clever reader must have noticed, where are all the super villains, the Jokers, Penguins, Magnetos, Green Goblins, Lex Luthors, etc? Haven’t figured it out yet? There are no super villains in the real world, silly, that’s just in comic books. And Watchmen is not some pulpy wish-fulfillment fantasy. It’s about the world you and I live in, filled with well-intentioned but imperfect people with passions, aspirations, dreams, psychoses, problems, frustrations and occasional triumphs like everyone else. It’s just that some of them wear costumes, that’s all.<br/><br/>Dave Gibbon’s Artwork/Tales of the Black Freighter:<br/><br/>The comic medium is distinct from novels because of the artwork, and the artwork of Watchmen is truly special. It is an example of total artistic commitment by both author and artist to achieve something never before seen in the genre. Dave Gibbons was given extremely detailed instructions by Moore for each frame, and they agree to use a 9-panel layout to give a uniform structure, unlike the more common variable size/number of panels. Gibbons inserted an incredible number of details into each panel, especially the various textual media found throughout the book, such as newspapers, graffiti, TV screens, book covers, etc. Much of these visual clues point to the impending countdown of the doomsday clock ticking down to nuclear Armageddon. There is also the pervasive metaphor of the smiley face button, which the Comedian uses for ironic purposes, but I see the iconic image of the drop of blood covering the face as a clever metaphor for how the innocent ideal of comic book heroism is tainted by the violence and death of the real world. There is such a wealth of visual details in the book, not to mention the book-within-a-book horrific pirate story called Tales of the Black Freighter, that I have never seen in graphic novels before. And the crowning touches are the inserts between chapters of excerpts from the autobiography of Hollis Mason (the original Nite Owl) that describe the origins of the first generation of superheroes (the Minutemen) in the 1940-50s, articles describing the history of Doc Manhattan and his impact on the Cold War, a description of the artists involved in early pirate comics, police documents of Rorshach, snippets from the New Frontiersman newspaper, even super-realistic notes from a Hollywood producer corresponding with Sally Jupiter, the original Silk Spectre. The verisimilitude and depth achieved with these interludes gives Watchmen the feel of a completely three-dimensional experience, encompassing storyline, character history, story-within-story, and visual elements. <br/><br/>Watchmen Film (2009, directed by Zack Snyder)<br/><br/>It was inevitable that a graphic novel as epic and complex as Watchmen would attract the attention of filmmakers. However, as is frequently a case with such a dense and complicated storyline, finding the right people to come up with the right screenwriters, producers, directors, and studio is an extremely difficult task. So the film got bounced around Hollywood for years and years, with directors and producers as diverse as Joel Silver, Terry Gilliam, Darren Aronofsky, and Paul Greenglass before the stars aligned and Zack Snyder was given the nod thanks to his distinctive visual work on Frank Miller’s 300.<br/><br/>The film version has a big budget of $120 million but hardly any major household names. The costs mostly involve the elaborate sets and special effects. The Watchmen graphic novel served as the storyboard. Visually, fans of the original will immediately recognize scene after scene from the comic, and Snyder did an excellent job bringing the dark and dystopian tone of the book to the screen. He also brings strength in the kinetic and violent action sequences, especially with sudden switches to slow motion in mid fight. The faithful careful attention to details extents to the beautiful geodesic glass artifact constructed by Doc Manhattan on Mars. It looks exactly as I envisioned it from Dave Gibbon’s artwork.<br/><br/>The acting isn’t quite as strong as the visual work, but I was satisfied with the fiercely uncompromising Rorshach and cynical Comedian. Nite Owl was played accurately as a fairly milquetoast aging superhero who has almost forgotten his glorious crime-fighting past, but I enjoyed his character when he finally takes out the Owlship with Silk Spectre to break Rorshach out of prison. The weakest actor by far played Silk Spectre, but a lot of my dislike may be more towards the character than the performance. Although Doc Manhattan is portrayed using CG, the actor Billy Crudup shot the scenes with the other actors. I like his cool and distant voice, it worked well with character. <br/><br/>Alan Moore refuses to have any involvement with film adaptations of his works, so writers David Hayter and Alex Tse were free to reshape Watchmen into something that could fit within the confines of a 2 ½ hour film. I think the two best decisions made in cutting down the story include removing all the Tales of the Black Freighter from the film, since this really was intended for readers of the comic as a tribute to pirate comics, and wouldn’t have worked in the movie as it lacks any direct connection with the story. I also liked how they and Snyder used the opening frames of the movie to depict the early Minutemen superheroes in technique that allows real-life stills to mimic photographs, but still retain some motion. This way viewers get a taste of what the early superheroes looked like without having to devote lengthy screen time to their backstories.<br/><br/>The biggest change made was to the final climactic scenes in Antarctica as Rorshach, Nite Owl, and Doc Manhattan attempt to foil Ozymandias’ evil master-plan. I actually thought this was overly complex and difficult to understand in book. <a class=\"jsShowSpoiler spoilerAction\">(view spoiler)</a><span class=\"spoilerContainer\" style=\"display: none\">[ Teleporting some freakish alien monster, whose brain was cloned from a human psychotic, into New York City in order to use the massive psychic shockwave from its brain to kill half the city? And this will somehow unite the warring superpowers against a common enemy? Perhaps this was a conscious dig by Moore at the implausibility of master plans by comic book villains? Since the rest of Watchmen seems very realistic within the alternate reality created by Moore, this part of the story struck me as farfetched. So I was actually quite happy when the film version made Ozymandias’ plan more concise and sensible. By simulating nuclear attacks in cities around the world and framing Doc Manhattan for it, this would be more likely to unite the world against Doc Manhattan, thereby completely alienating him from humanity and also eliminating him as a rival to Adrian Veight’s plan to rule the world in the aftermath. <a class=\"jsHideSpoiler spoilerAction\">(hide spoiler)</a>]</span><br/><br/>I’ve heard that many Watchmen fans really hated the film version, but I didn’t feel that way at all. While the film of necessity had to shed many of the side and back stories and incredible background details that make the graphic novel so rich, I think they retained the important aspects of the storyline and focused on them. I also think the film piqued the interest of many viewers to give the graphic novel a try, directing new blood to the comic/graphic novel genre. There are so many disastrous comic book adaptations out there, so Zack Snyder’s film is much better than that.</span>\n",

       " <span id=\"freeText3290102054467276774\" style=\"display:none\">I admire Alan Moore as a public figure and regard how much he apparently shook up superhero comics. That’s not going to make me like <i>The Watchmen</i>. Fundamentally, every character felt like the same uninspired shape, that jaded celebrity in search of catharsis at the expense of someone else. I held out hope for The Comedian to play a dynamic personality, for if ever a universe needed The Joker to kick it in the ass, it was this one. Instead, The Comedian turned out to be the apex cynic, and so I didn't care who killed him, I didn't care why Rorschach was torturing people, and I definitely didn't care about the world going to hell because it was so obviously not in contention. This was just more bleak fiction where, naturally, things go to hell. That's not conflict. That's as destined an ending as happiness at the end of an episode of Care Bears.<br/><br/>There's craft to this, and I won't pretend otherwise. Gibbons throws talent at the project, with striking angles on many panels, a strong sense of color, and moments of brilliance, like Rorschach's mask mimicking the clouds he watches. And Moore obviously wrote this as a dissection, with ample references to the American superhero comics he's critiquing by making people similar to them miserable. It was simply too dreary and monotonous an experience to feel worth it.<br/><br/><i>The Watchmen</i> is considered one of the most important comic books in history, and I won't pretend its hype didn't hurt my experience of it. If not for so many people telling me to read it, I might have dismissed it as more violent maudlin SF. Hype and legacy are not its fault, and I regretted gritting my teeth against those elements.<br/><br/>Because man, the costumes are less spectacular, the origins more bleak, the heroes more despicable and/or self-loathing, the villains almost non-existent, the relationships more strained and the political overtones more blatant than were almost ever seen in mainstream comics before. The comic’s effects were massive: it ushered in a new wave of \"cool,\" where Superman and Spider-Man were lame, and everyone wanted murderous and self-destructive anti-heroes. This movement spawned approximately ten good characters and millions of pages of worthless crap, so I'm still not sure why its existence as critique considered a good thing, but it's certainly a landmark in the history of comic book writers who were so self-loathing they had to call their work \"graphic novels.\" I found it simply painful to read back then and not worth owning today. Behind what has fast become the cliché of comics (and popular film in general) are some slivers of real humanity and possible redemption or at least love, which are vital. Yet new readers who pick this up today are going to wonder what was so important about a slow, long, drawn-out murder mystery surrounding sociopaths, rapists and killers who call themselves superheroes, yet who only care about each other when they die, in a dated dystopia that isn't even half as self-aware, cynical or meaningful as what's being pumped out today.<br/></span>\n",

Rorschach! GAH!), and there were some serious twists in the book that, while I can't say I didn't see them coming, still really affected me strongly.<br/><br/>This is not a comic book for those who want their superheroes infallible icons of Americana. This is a graphic novel in every sense of the phrase. The violence is graphic, but not gratuitously so. It is there for impact upon the reader, and it works. There is nudity and sex, but again, never gratuitous. This novel showcases the sort of \"behind the scenes\" stuff that was never really shown in all the golden and silver age comic books. You almost know reading those old books that there's a seedier underside to the comic world that's only ever hinted at in most older books. Watchmen lifts up the sewer lid and shoves you down the hole to see just how deep the crap can pile up down there.<br/><br/>If I have one complaint about this book it's that I figured out all the twists and turns way too early. But I am an English teacher, after all, and I'm sort of trained to note foreshadowing and whatnot. It was still a fun ride, though, and watching the characters react to what was going on made the whole trip very worthwhile.<br/><br/>Fantastic writing. Art is kind of old school, but still good. The only thing there that consistently bugged me was the original Silk Spectre's hairdo. *shudder*</span>\n",

But every once in a while, I make myself read a certain book for the literature value it has or for the sheer reason that I think I should. *Watchmen\" was one of these cases. I don't regret reading it. I can see why this book has such a significant value as a comic. The ending was specially a very nice surprise and I find it very refreshing when I think of all the comic books that exist to depict Superheroes and their struggle to save the world but Seriously, the journey was....BORING! <br/><br/>If I wasn't reading this in a buddy read with my amazing friend, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12222982-roya\" rel=\"nofollow\">Roya</a>, I would have skipped to the very last chapter and I think I would have been FINE. Yes, It's a Hugo Award-winning graphic novel that has appeared in Time magazine's \"All-Time 100 Greatest Novels\" list. I will say it again, I am one of those people that prefer to enjoy what they read. If there is real depth to the story, even better! <br/><br/>I LOVE anti-heroes and this COMIC still bored me. The problem is that I don't think of these characters as real anti-heroes. They are not flawed human beings that are forced into difficult situations and have to make difficult choices. If that's what you want, try \"Batman\"! These characters are mostly pathetic, annoying, selfish, bitchy and need professional help and shouldn't be responsible for their own health and safety, let alone the freaking humanity! There were nice characters too but they either lost their touch along the way or didn't actually get to do anything! When reading an award-wining comic that <i>\"chronicles the fall from grace of a group of super-heroes plagued by all-too-human failings. Along the way, the concept of the super-hero is dissected as the heroes are stalked by an unknown assassin\"</i>, boredom shouldn't be an issue!<br/><br/>It's indeed very unique and definitely has literature value but I simply don't see all the fuss and find it overrated. For me, It was simply too busy trying to be deep and teach the readers a lesson while there wasn't any real depth to it and I actually didn't learn anything. There wasn't anything to learn. I don't even agree with this comic's philosophy, if there is actually any. I am a realistic person that tries to stay positive and I believe while humanity is not perfect, it's not hopeless and in my opinion, the story failed to prove that. It failed to prove the value of life, love and hope! Yes, there is some insight and wisdom SOMEWHERE in this novel but not enough.*hides from the angry mob* <br/><br/>Lastly, most of the costumes are SUPER lame and I don't care how old this comic is. These are drawings, they didn't have to actually make these costumes back then and I can't get over these characters' awful sense of fashion. <br/><br/>In conclusion, I liked it but it's not really that spectacular and I recommend it if you want to read all the classic and award-wining books in the world or if you are really into philosophy and headache.<br/></span>\n",

But every once in a while, I make myself read a certain book for the literature value it has or for the sheer reason that I think I should. *Watchmen\" was one of these cases. I don't regret reading it. I can see why this book has such a significant value as a comic. The ending was specially a very nice surprise and I find it very refreshing when I think of all the comic books that exist to depict Superheroes and their struggle to save the world but Seriously, the journey was....BORING!<br/><br/>If I wasn't reading this in a buddy read with my amazing friend, Roya, I would have skipped to the very last chapter and I think I would have been FINE. Yes, It's a Hugo Award-winning graphic novel that has appeared in Time magazine's \"All-Time 100 Greatest Novels\" list. I will say it again, I am one of those people that prefer to enjoy what they read. If there is real depth to the story, even better!<br/><br/>I LOVE anti-heroes and this COMIC still bored me. The problem is that I don't think of these characters as real anti-heroes. They are not flawed human beings that are forced into difficult situations and have to make difficult choices. If that's what you want, try \"Batman\"! These characters are mostly pathetic, annoying, selfish, bitchy and need professional help and shouldn't be responsible for their own health and safety, let alone the freaking humanity! There were nice characters too but they either lost their touch along the way or didn't actually get to do anything! When reading an award-wining comic that \"chronicles the fall from grace of a group of super-heroes plagued by all-too-human failings. Along the way, the concept of the super-hero is dissected as the heroes are stalked by an unknown assassin\", boredom shouldn't be an issue!<br/><br/>It's indeed very unique and definitely has literature value but I simply don't see all the fuss and find it overrated. For me, It was simply too busy trying to be deep and teach the readers a lesson while there wasn't any real depth to it and I actually didn't learn anything. There wasn't anything to learn. I don't even agree with this comic's philosophy, if there is actually any. I am a realistic person that tries to stay positive and I believe while humanity is not perfect, it's not hopeless and in my opinion, the story failed to prove that. It failed to prove the value of life, love and hope! Yes, there is some insight and wisdom SOMEWHERE in this novel but not enough.*hides from the angry mob*<br/><br/>Lastly, most of the costumes are SUPER lame and I don't care how old this comic is. These are drawings, they didn't have to actually make these costumes back then and I can't get over these characters' awful sense of fashion.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I liked it but it's not really that spectacular and I recommend it if you want to read all the classic and award-wining books in the world or if you are really into philosophy and headache.</span>\n",

And so here is my statement about the book in one sentence: I liked the story but the philosophy behind the novel I did not like. <br/><br/>Watchmen - many people know the idea behind the title 'Who will watch the Watchmen' - but not everyone has read this acclaimed novel. As the title suggests it is a graphic novel that deals with the idea of who exists to watch the superheroes if they go out of control. And really, part of my problem with reading this novel is that when a hero goes out of control you get a villain. I don't subscribe to the idea of the anti-hero like many people. I believe in absolutes and as such I think that the hero is the character who performs more good than he does evil. <br/><br/>In the end of this novel the whole idea of what Watchmen is really trying to convey wraps together. It's really about psychological conflict, about Nihilism and about the Jungian shadow. Many psychological theories I do not subscribe to but find useful to use as discussion points. Because I do not believe that the world is all full of darkness and evil when you strip it down as Watchmen appears to portray. I believe that there is much evil in life but that there is also hope and light for anyone to see. <br/><br/>I did not like either the idea that perhaps in order to create greater good we must compromise. But then I suppose that was the whole point of the novel. The novel was full of compromise made by these super men who are really very human in morality. As Rorschach* says \"No, never compromise.\" <br/><br/>Of course it could simply be the spirit within me that says 'I dislike non Justice League DC comics on the whole.' After all for me while Marvel make few brilliant comics for me to enjoy I do rate them still highly due to the overall story telling in them. DC just don't have the fun of Marvel - they're too dark and gloomy except when the Joker plays with Batman or Superman battles a few enemies. On that note Marvel reigns supreme and The Avengers is one of the greatest films of all. <br/><br/>*Named after the blot test and definitely the most interesting character in the comics as a violent vigilante</span>\n",

The only redeeming thing about <i>The Night Circus</i> is that I didn't feel the one star compulsion to start a bonfire so I could properly dispose of it, hence two stars, but in this case it does not mean I enjoyed the book at all.<br/><br/>From the Goodreads summary: <i>\"But behind the scenes, a fierce competition is underway—a duel between two young magicians, Celia and Marco, who have been trained since childhood expressly for this purpose by their mercurial instructors. Unbeknownst to them, this is a game in which only one can be left standing, and the circus is but the stage for a remarkable battle of imagination and will. Despite themselves, however, Celia and Marco tumble headfirst into love—a deep, magical love that makes the lights flicker and the room grow warm whenever they so much as brush hands.\"</i><br/><br/>The above is a series of filthy, filthy lies intended to make you part with your money. Did the person who wrote the description read the same book I read? Or did he get so bored that he fell asleep and was forced to wing it for a deadline? If that's the case, I feel for the poor guy since I fell asleep reading this a few times, but I don't forgive the lies.<br/><br/><b>Lie Number One:</b> \"A Fierce Competition\"<br/><i>What Actually Happens:</i> Instead of reading about a battle of wits, ingenuity, and talent taking place on a magical field you get two slugs racing against each other... over the course of sixteen or so years. Yeah, all those extra years might kill the intensity, but think of the emotional investment you make in those slugs. You can bring your new born baby to see them and go again every year as the fierce competition between the two of them goes on and on and on and on and on... <a class=\"jsShowSpoiler spoilerAction\">(view spoiler)</a><span class=\"spoilerContainer\" style=\"display: none\">[and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on. <a class=\"jsHideSpoiler spoilerAction\">(hide spoiler)</a>]</span> Your child will have a driver's license when the fierce competition is over.<br/><br/><b>Lie Number Two:</b> \"A Duel\"<br/><i>What Actually Happens:</i> For a significant part of the story the two 'dueling' magicians are raised separately with no knowledge of one another. For ANOTHER significant part of the story only one magician is aware of who they are 'competing' against. By the time the magician who was unaware is finally brought up to date they have been collaborating on projects for years... Yes, you read that right. They never stand toe to toe in any sort of competitive sense. They build little attractions for the circus and sometimes they built them together, leaving gaps for the other to fill because they like each other's work. This is how they 'fiercely compete' during their 'duel.'<br/><br/><b>Lie Number Three:</b> \"Trained Since Childhood Expressly For This Purpose\"<br/><i>What Actually Happens:</i> This sounds like a warrior toddler getting out of bed and doing push-ups (or the magical equivalent) every day for forever with the intent of search and destroy. In reality, they both have haphazard educations from sociopathic father figures* who never tell them a damn thing about the competition. They don't know what they're doing or how to play the game (and neither does the reader for most of the book). I believe this is because the author had no idea how to make them actually compete or what she was doing beyond establishing a lot of overly descriptive scene setting. The training is just education from two different schools of thought on the subject of magic. They're not given any idea of how to be the victor. It's an experiment, which is vastly different from training a warrior as this is made to sound.<br/><br/>*The father figures are equally psychotic, suggesting that both of their philosophies are fundamentally flawed because they're both batshit crazy. One slices his daughter's fingers open over and over again to teach her how to heal herself, even smashes her hand to break her bones for a lesson, and the other does not know his ward's name until he is nearly an adult. Neither of them ever face any consequences for the things they do to the children or the many experimental children before them.<br/><br/><b>Lie Number Four:</b> \"Only One Can Be Left Standing\"<br/><i>What Actually Happens:</i> Aside from the obvious <a class=\"jsShowSpoiler spoilerAction\">(view spoiler)</a><span class=\"spoilerContainer\" style=\"display: none\">[happily ever after <a class=\"jsHideSpoiler spoilerAction\">(hide spoiler)</a>]</span> ending the author works in, there's no reason that one of them has to die. The previous \"battle\" before this one (I'm sneering at that) lasted thirty-seven fucking years and only ended because one of the magicians committed suicide. There's absolutely no sense of urgency in this book. It moves at the languid pace my grandmother's overweight poodle used to meander around at, like there was no where to go and nothing to do. The author tries to force some urgency and pacing in by having both characters willing to lose the game so the other can win... but why? If you're playing a game of Monopoly with a friend (Monopoly might be too exciting a comparison to use here but lets work with it) and someone's going to need to commit suicide at the end of it then you... don't stop playing. You don't even have to sit at the board all day every day. You can come back once a year and make a fucking move. No one in their right mind would jump up and yell <b>'I shall die for you my dearest!'</b> <i>especially</i> if you know your friend will jump up and say the same thing louder.<br/><br/>I don't know what happens if no one commits suicide? Does someone self-implode from excess magic? We never find out anything substantial. We don't know how past competitions ended beyond that single one. The book is left open-ended so that the publishers can milk this monstrosity all over again if it sells well.<br/><br/><b>Lie Number Five:</b> \"Despite themselves, however, Celia and Marco tumble headfirst into love—a deep, magical love that makes the lights flicker and the room grow warm whenever they so much as brush hands.\"<br/><i>What Actually Happens:</i> After many, many years of not knowing who the other magician is, Marco reveals himself to Celia. The author tells you sparks fly. Sparks do not actually fly because these two 'characters' are about as flat as they come. There's no resisting falling in love. They just decide to do it in true Edward/Bella/Twilight fashion. There's no \"deep, magical love\". The love story is next to non-existent. On top of that, Marco continues to see someone else for years after... why? I don't fucking know. But it's a big god damn deal because she goes nuts and disrupts some of the magic of the circus and allows Bad Things to happen.<br/><br/>There's so many other things wrong with the book. There's intertwining timelines. We jump back and forth decades in time, vanish off into characters who are at first totally unrelated to the circus and then have minor roles later on. None of the core characters are well-developed and none of the relationships are even remotely worth reading about. I don't get why the book is set in the period it was set in. Social standards aren't kept up. Maybe it was more atmosphere? Maybe it was so that the author didn't have to deal with the people who would show up to debunk the magic of the circus.<br/><br/>On that note, the magic was so obviously magic that I got annoyed. I feel slightly insane for typing that out, but hear me out. It's all supposed to be real magic done with a wink and a nod so people won't realize it's real magic. Turn a jacket into a raven and then grin and wave so people believe you just performed the best slight of hand ever. Of course, the tricks were too fantastical to be believed. The wooden animals on the carousel breathe... and no amount of great mechanics could have made that happen 100 plus years ago. There's ice gardens and foggy mazes <b>made of clouds</b>, fires that never EVER go out, no one in the circus or relating to it ages (minus kids), and circus tents set up by invisible people. Everyone in the circus assumes the set up is done by assistants... what? assistants they never see? Where are the circus people when the set up and packing happens? Where do they think the crew goes after? Really, Book? Really?<br/><br/>All of this happened as a contest between two old men who do nothing but sacrifice the lives of children so they can have the satisfaction of being right about things that are <b>\n",
       "<i>never. fully. described.</i>\n",
       "</b> One prefers things more obvious and in your face, the other is quiet and prefers a more book based education. <b>Seriously? This was the propelling point for the entire novel?!</b><br/><br/>The world building and magic rules also suck. Anything the author wants to have happen can happen with minor limits. The only reason to read this book is the lovely descriptions and abundant scene setting. I do not recommend it to people who like a good story, although if you're into abundant prose give it a whirl. It's kind of like reading a travel brochure while high as a kite.<br/><br/>Edit: To anyone who has not read the book and might be making their decision to read/not read based on this review, I wanted to say many people I respect found more redeeming qualities in the book than I did. <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/172289998\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here</a> <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/326291875\" rel=\"nofollow\">is</a> one such review.

       " ['Contains some minor spoilers.I disliked this book, which means I ought to rate it one star, but it is not as awful as my one star shelf. One star books have to really repulse me to get that rating. The only redeeming thing about The Night Circus is that I didn\\'t feel the one star compulsion to start a bonfire so I could properly dispose of it, hence two stars, but in this case it does not mean I enjoyed the book at all.From the Goodreads summary: \"But behind the scenes, a fierce competition is underway—a duel between two young magicians, Celia and Marco, who have been trained since childhood expressly for this purpose by their mercurial instructors. Unbeknownst to them, this is a game in which only one can be left standing, and the circus is but the stage for a remarkable battle of imagination and will. Despite themselves, however, Celia and Marco tumble headfirst into love—a deep, magical love that makes the lights flicker and the room grow warm whenever they so much as brush hands.\"The above is a series of filthy, filthy lies intended to make you part with your money. Did the person who wrote the description read the same book I read? Or did he get so bored that he fell asleep and was forced to wing it for a deadline? If that\\'s the case, I feel for the poor guy since I fell asleep reading this a few times, but I don\\'t forgive the lies.Lie Number One: \"A Fierce Competition\"What Actually Happens: Instead of reading about a battle of wits, ingenuity, and talent taking place on a magical field you get two slugs racing against each other... over the course of sixteen or so years. Yeah, all those extra years might kill the intensity, but think of the emotional investment you make in those slugs. You can bring your new born baby to see them and go again every year as the fierce competition between the two of them goes on and on and on and on and on... (view spoiler)[and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on. (hide spoiler)] Your child will have a driver\\'s license when the fierce competition is over.Lie Number Two: \"A Duel\"What Actually Happens: For a significant part of the story the two \\'dueling\\' magicians are raised separately with no knowledge of one another. For ANOTHER significant part of the story only one magician is aware of who they are \\'competing\\' against. By the time the magician who was unaware is finally brought up to date they have been collaborating on projects for years... Yes, you read that right. They never stand toe to toe in any sort of competitive sense. They build little attractions for the circus and sometimes they built them together, leaving gaps for the other to fill because they like each other\\'s work. This is how they \\'fiercely compete\\' during their \\'duel.\\'Lie Number Three: \"Trained Since Childhood Expressly For This Purpose\"What Actually Happens: This sounds like a warrior toddler getting out of bed and doing push-ups (or the magical equivalent) every day for forever with the intent of search and destroy. In reality, they both have haphazard educations from sociopathic father figures* who never tell them a damn thing about the competition. They don\\'t know what they\\'re doing or how to play the game (and neither does the reader for most of the book). I believe this is because the author had no idea how to make them actually compete or what she was doing beyond establishing a lot of overly descriptive scene setting. The training is just education from two different schools of thought on the subject of magic. They\\'re not given any idea of how to be the victor. It\\'s an experiment, which is vastly different from training a warrior as this is made to sound.*The father figures are equally psychotic, suggesting that both of their philosophies are fundamentally flawed because they\\'re both batshit crazy. One slices his daughter\\'s fingers open over and over again to teach her how to heal herself, even smashes her hand to break her bones for a lesson, and the other does not know his ward\\'s name until he is nearly an adult. Neither of them ever face any consequences for the things they do to the children or the many experimental children before them.Lie Number Four: \"Only One Can Be Left Standing\"What Actually Happens: Aside from the obvious (view spoiler)[happily ever after (hide spoiler)] ending the author works in, there\\'s no reason that one of them has to die. The previous \"battle\" before this one (I\\'m sneering at that) lasted thirty-seven fucking years and only ended because one of the magicians committed suicide. There\\'s absolutely no sense of urgency in this book. It moves at the languid pace my grandmother\\'s overweight poodle used to meander around at, like there was no where to go and nothing to do. The author tries to force some urgency and pacing in by having both characters willing to lose the game so the other can win... but why? If you\\'re playing a game of Monopoly with a friend (Monopoly might be too exciting a comparison to use here but lets work with it) and someone\\'s going to need to commit suicide at the end of it then you... don\\'t stop playing. You don\\'t even have to sit at the board all day every day. You can come back once a year and make a fucking move. No one in their right mind would jump up and yell \\'I shall die for you my dearest!\\' especially if you know your friend will jump up and say the same thing louder.I don\\'t know what happens if no one commits suicide? Does someone self-implode from excess magic? We never find out anything substantial. We don\\'t know how past competitions ended beyond that single one. The book is left open-ended so that the publishers can milk this monstrosity all over again if it sells well.Lie Number Five: \"Despite themselves, however, Celia and Marco tumble headfirst into love—a deep, magical love that makes the lights flicker and the room grow warm whenever they so much as brush hands.\"What Actually Happens: After many, many years of not knowing who the other magician is, Marco reveals himself to Celia. The author tells you sparks fly. Sparks do not actually fly because these two \\'characters\\' are about as flat as they come. There\\'s no resisting falling in love. They just decide to do it in true Edward/Bella/Twilight fashion. There\\'s no \"deep, magical love\". The love story is next to non-existent. On top of that, Marco continues to see someone else for years after... why? I don\\'t fucking know. But it\\'s a big god damn deal because she goes nuts and disrupts some of the magic of the circus and allows Bad Things to happen.There\\'s so many other things wrong with the book. There\\'s intertwining timelines. We jump back and forth decades in time, vanish off into characters who are at first totally unrelated to the circus and then have minor roles later on. None of the core characters are well-developed and none of the relationships are even remotely worth reading about. I don\\'t get why the book is set in the period it was set in. Social standards aren\\'t kept up. Maybe it was more atmosphere? Maybe it was so that the author didn\\'t have to deal with the people who would show up to debunk the magic of the circus.On that note, the magic was so obviously magic that I got annoyed. I feel slightly insane for typing that out, but hear me out. It\\'s all supposed to be real magic done with a wink and a nod so people won\\'t realize it\\'s real magic. Turn a jacket into a raven and then grin and wave so people believe you just performed the best slight of hand ever. Of course, the tricks were too fantastical to be believed. The wooden animals on the carousel breathe... and no amount of great mechanics could have made that happen 100 plus years ago. There\\'s ice gardens and foggy mazes made of clouds, fires that never EVER go out, no one in the circus or relating to it ages (minus kids), and circus tents set up by invisible people. Everyone in the circus assumes the set up is done by assistants... what? assistants they never see? Where are the circus people when the set up and packing happens? Where do they think the crew goes after? Really, Book? Really?All of this happened as a contest between two old men who do nothing but sacrifice the lives of children so they can have the satisfaction of being right about things that are \\nnever. fully. described.\\n One prefers things more obvious and in your face, the other is quiet and prefers a more book based education. Seriously? This was the propelling point for the entire novel?!The world building and magic rules also suck. Anything the author wants to have happen can happen with minor limits. The only reason to read this book is the lovely descriptions and abundant scene setting. I do not recommend it to people who like a good story, although if you\\'re into abundant prose give it a whirl. It\\'s kind of like reading a travel brochure while high as a kite.Edit: To anyone who has not read the book and might be making their decision to read/not read based on this review, I wanted to say many people I respect found more redeeming qualities in the book than I did.

       "<bound method Tag.get_text of <span id=\"freeText5893448145973466932\" style=\"display:none\">Since the movie came out, I've found myself having to explain why Watchmen is important and interesting. Despite being the most revered comic book of all time, it never really entered the mainstream until the film. Now, people are rushing to read it in droves, but approaching Watchmen without an understanding of its history and influences means missing most of what makes it truly special.<br/><br/>The entire work is an exploration of the history and purpose of the superhero genre: how readers connect to it, and what it means philosophically. Moore stretches from fond satire to outright subversion to minute allusion, encasing the once-simple genre in layers of meaning. Even as he refines and compresses the genre, he also constantly pushes its boundaries. Watchmen is unapologetic, unflinching, and most miraculous of all, freed from the shame which binds so many comics.<br/><br/>Moore never stoops to making an entirely sympathetic character. There is no real hero, and none of the characters represents Moore's own opinions. Superhero comics are almost always built around wholly sympathetic, admirable characters. They represent what people wish they were, and they do the things normal people wish they could do.<br/><br/>It is immediately gratifying escapism, which many people attach themselves to, especially the meek who lead tedious, unfulfilled lives. Many people also do the same thing with celebrities, idolizing them and patterning their own lives on the choices those famous people make. But in this modern age of reality TV and gossip media, we know that celebrities are not ideal people.<br/><br/>Indeed, their wealth and prominence often drives them mad. While everyone else views the world from the bottom up, they view it from the top down, and this skewed perspective wreaks havoc with their morality and sense of self. Moore's superheroes represent something even beyond this celebrity. Not only are they on the top of the heap, but they are physically different from other human beings. Their superiority is not just in their heads and pocketbooks, but in their genetics.<br/><br/>They are not meant to be sympathetic, they are meant to be human. They are as flawed and conflicted as any of us, and while we may sometimes agree with them, as often, we find them distant and unstable.<br/><br/>Many people have fingered Rorschach as the 'hero' of this tale, but that is as flawed as pinning Satan as the hero of 'Paradise Lost'. Following the classic fantasy of power, Rorschach inflicts his morality on the world around him. But, since he is not an ideal, but a flawed human, we recognize that his one-man fascist revolution is unjustified.<br/><br/>We all feel that we see the world clearly, and everyone around us is somehow confused and mistaken. Often, we cannot understand how others can possibly think they way they do. Sometimes, we try to communicate, but there is often an impassable barrier between two minds: no matter how much we talk or how pure our intentions, one will never be able to convince the other.<br/><br/>We all feel the temptation to act out--if only those disagreeable people were gone, the world would be a better place. While this justification may be enough for most comic writers, Moore realizes that the other guy thinks everything would be better if we were gone. Rorschach lashes out because his ideas are too 'out there' and he is too socially insecure to convince anyone that he is right. He is unwilling to question himself, and so becomes a force of his own violent affirmation.<br/><br/>Most who sympathize with him are like him: short-sighted and desperate, unable to communicate with or understand their fellow man. Many are unwilling even to try. Rorschach becomes a satire of the super hero code, which says that as long as you call someone evil, you are justified in beating him to death. This same code is also commonly adopted as foreign policy by leaders in war, which Moore constantly reminds us of with references to real world politics.<br/><br/>The rest of the characters take on other aspects of violent morality, with varying levels of self-righteousness. Like the British government of the 1980's, which inspired Moore, or the American government of the beginning of this century, we can see that equating physical power with moral power is both flawed and dangerous. Subjugating others 'for their own good' is only a justification for leaders who feel entitled to take what they can by force.<br/><br/>The only character with the power to really change the world doesn't do so. His point of view is so drastically different from the common man that he sees that resolving such petty squabbles by force won't actually solve anything. It won't put people on the same page, and will only create more conflict and inequality. Dr. Manhattan sees man only as a tiny, nearly insignificant part of the vast complexity of the cosmos. Though he retains some of his humanity, his perspective is so remote that he sees little justification for interference, any more than you or I would crush the ants of one colony to promote the other.<br/><br/>The ending presents another example of one man trying to enforce his moral solutions upon the entire world. Not only does this subvert the role of the super hero throughout comic book history, but reflects upon the political themes touched on throughout the book. Man is already under the subjugation of men--they may not be superhuman, but still hold the lives of countless billions in their hands. It is no coincidence that Moore shows us president Nixon, a compulsive liar and paranoid delusional who ran the most powerful country in the world as he saw fit.<br/><br/>Moore's strength as a writer--even more than creating flawed, human characters--is telling many different stories, which are really the same story told in different ways, all layered over each other. Each story then comments on the others, presenting many views. His plots are deceptively complex, but since they all share themes, they flow one into the next with an effortlessness that marks Moore as a truly sophisticated writer.<br/><br/>Many readers probably read right across the top of this story, flowing smoothly from one moment to the next, and never even recognizing the bustling philosophical exploration that moves the whole thing along. The story-within-a-story 'The Black Freighter' winds itself through the whole of Watchmen, and for Moore, serves several purposes. Firstly, it is another subversion of comic book tropes: Moore is tapping into the history of the genre, when books about pirates, cowboys, spacemen, monsters, and teen love filled the racks next to the superhuman heroes before that variety was obliterated by the Comics Code (yet another authoritarian act of destruction by people who thought they were morally superior). <br/><br/>But in the world of Watchmen, there are real superheroes, and they are difficult, flawed, politically motivated, and petty. So, superhero comics are unpopular in the Watchmen world, because there, superheroes are fraught with political and moral complexity. These are not the requisite parts of an escapist romp. We don't have comic books about our politicians, after all. We may have political satire, but that's hardly escapist fun.<br/><br/>So, instead they read about pirates. Beyond referencing the history of comics, 'The Black Freighter' works intertextually with Watchmen. The themes and events of one follow the other, and the transitions between them create a continuous exploration of ideas. Moore never breaks off his story, because even superficially unrelated scenes flow from one to the other, in a continuous, multilayered, self-referential narrative.<br/><br/>I continually stand in awe of Moore's ability to connect such disparate threads. Many comic authors since have tried to do the same, but from Morrison to Ellis to Ennis, they have shown that striking that right balance is one of the hardest things an author can do. Most of Moore's followers end up with an unpalatable mish-mash instead of a carefully prepared and seasoned dish.<br/><br/>Unlike most comic authors, Moore scripted the entire layout for the artist: every panel, background object, and action. Using this absolute control, Moore stretched the comic book medium for all it was worth, filling every panel with references, allusions, and details which pointed to the fullness and complexity of his world. Moore even creates meaning with structure, so that the size, shape, and configuration of panels tell much of the story for him. <br/><br/>One of the volumes is even mirrored, so that the first page is almost identical to the last, the second page to the second last, and so on. That most readers don't even notice this is even more remarkable. That means that Moore used an extremely stylized technique so well that it didn't interfere with the story at all.<br/><br/>But therein lies the difficulty: if a reader isn't looking for it, they will probably have no idea what makes this books so original and so remarkable. This especially true if they don't know the tropes Moore is subverting, or the allusive history he calls upon to contextualize his ideas.<br/><br/>While many readers enjoy the book purely on its artistic merit, the strength of the writing, and the well-paced plot, others disregard the work when they are unable to recognize what makes it revolutionary. One might as well try to read Paradise Lost with no knowledge of the Bible, or watch Looney Toons without a familiarity with 1940's pop culture.<br/><br/>It is not a perfect work, but there is no such thing. Moore's lead heroine is unremarkable, which Moore himself has lamented. He did not feel entirely comfortable writing women at that point in his career, and the character was forced on him by the higher ups.

       "'Since the movie came out, I\\'ve found myself having to explain why Watchmen is important and interesting. Despite being the most revered comic book of all time, it never really entered the mainstream until the film. Now, people are rushing to read it in droves, but approaching Watchmen without an understanding of its history and influences means missing most of what makes it truly special.The entire work is an exploration of the history and purpose of the superhero genre: how readers connect to it, and what it means philosophically. Moore stretches from fond satire to outright subversion to minute allusion, encasing the once-simple genre in layers of meaning. Even as he refines and compresses the genre, he also constantly pushes its boundaries. Watchmen is unapologetic, unflinching, and most miraculous of all, freed from the shame which binds so many comics.Moore never stoops to making an entirely sympathetic character. There is no real hero, and none of the characters represents Moore\\'s own opinions. Superhero comics are almost always built around wholly sympathetic, admirable characters. They represent what people wish they were, and they do the things normal people wish they could do.It is immediately gratifying escapism, which many people attach themselves to, especially the meek who lead tedious, unfulfilled lives. Many people also do the same thing with celebrities, idolizing them and patterning their own lives on the choices those famous people make. But in this modern age of reality TV and gossip media, we know that celebrities are not ideal people.Indeed, their wealth and prominence often drives them mad. While everyone else views the world from the bottom up, they view it from the top down, and this skewed perspective wreaks havoc with their morality and sense of self. Moore\\'s superheroes represent something even beyond this celebrity. Not only are they on the top of the heap, but they are physically different from other human beings. Their superiority is not just in their heads and pocketbooks, but in their genetics.They are not meant to be sympathetic, they are meant to be human. They are as flawed and conflicted as any of us, and while we may sometimes agree with them, as often, we find them distant and unstable.Many people have fingered Rorschach as the \\'hero\\' of this tale, but that is as flawed as pinning Satan as the hero of \\'Paradise Lost\\'. Following the classic fantasy of power, Rorschach inflicts his morality on the world around him. But, since he is not an ideal, but a flawed human, we recognize that his one-man fascist revolution is unjustified.We all feel that we see the world clearly, and everyone around us is somehow confused and mistaken. Often, we cannot understand how others can possibly think they way they do. Sometimes, we try to communicate, but there is often an impassable barrier between two minds: no matter how much we talk or how pure our intentions, one will never be able to convince the other.We all feel the temptation to act out--if only those disagreeable people were gone, the world would be a better place. While this justification may be enough for most comic writers, Moore realizes that the other guy thinks everything would be better if we were gone. Rorschach lashes out because his ideas are too \\'out there\\' and he is too socially insecure to convince anyone that he is right. He is unwilling to question himself, and so becomes a force of his own violent affirmation.Most who sympathize with him are like him: short-sighted and desperate, unable to communicate with or understand their fellow man. Many are unwilling even to try. Rorschach becomes a satire of the super hero code, which says that as long as you call someone evil, you are justified in beating him to death. This same code is also commonly adopted as foreign policy by leaders in war, which Moore constantly reminds us of with references to real world politics.The rest of the characters take on other aspects of violent morality, with varying levels of self-righteousness. Like the British government of the 1980\\'s, which inspired Moore, or the American government of the beginning of this century, we can see that equating physical power with moral power is both flawed and dangerous. Subjugating others \\'for their own good\\' is only a justification for leaders who feel entitled to take what they can by force.The only character with the power to really change the world doesn\\'t do so. His point of view is so drastically different from the common man that he sees that resolving such petty squabbles by force won\\'t actually solve anything. It won\\'t put people on the same page, and will only create more conflict and inequality. Dr. Manhattan sees man only as a tiny, nearly insignificant part of the vast complexity of the cosmos. Though he retains some of his humanity, his perspective is so remote that he sees little justification for interference, any more than you or I would crush the ants of one colony to promote the other.The ending presents another example of one man trying to enforce his moral solutions upon the entire world. Not only does this subvert the role of the super hero throughout comic book history, but reflects upon the political themes touched on throughout the book. Man is already under the subjugation of men--they may not be superhuman, but still hold the lives of countless billions in their hands. It is no coincidence that Moore shows us president Nixon, a compulsive liar and paranoid delusional who ran the most powerful country in the world as he saw fit.Moore\\'s strength as a writer--even more than creating flawed, human characters--is telling many different stories, which are really the same story told in different ways, all layered over each other. Each story then comments on the others, presenting many views. His plots are deceptively complex, but since they all share themes, they flow one into the next with an effortlessness that marks Moore as a truly sophisticated writer.Many readers probably read right across the top of this story, flowing smoothly from one moment to the next, and never even recognizing the bustling philosophical exploration that moves the whole thing along. The story-within-a-story \\'The Black Freighter\\' winds itself through the whole of Watchmen, and for Moore, serves several purposes. Firstly, it is another subversion of comic book tropes: Moore is tapping into the history of the genre, when books about pirates, cowboys, spacemen, monsters, and teen love filled the racks next to the superhuman heroes before that variety was obliterated by the Comics Code (yet another authoritarian act of destruction by people who thought they were morally superior). But in the world of Watchmen, there are real superheroes, and they are difficult, flawed, politically motivated, and petty. So, superhero comics are unpopular in the Watchmen world, because there, superheroes are fraught with political and moral complexity. These are not the requisite parts of an escapist romp. We don\\'t have comic books about our politicians, after all. We may have political satire, but that\\'s hardly escapist fun.So, instead they read about pirates. Beyond referencing the history of comics, \\'The Black Freighter\\' works intertextually with Watchmen. The themes and events of one follow the other, and the transitions between them create a continuous exploration of ideas. Moore never breaks off his story, because even superficially unrelated scenes flow from one to the other, in a continuous, multilayered, self-referential narrative.I continually stand in awe of Moore\\'s ability to connect such disparate threads. Many comic authors since have tried to do the same, but from Morrison to Ellis to Ennis, they have shown that striking that right balance is one of the hardest things an author can do. Most of Moore\\'s followers end up with an unpalatable mish-mash instead of a carefully prepared and seasoned dish.Unlike most comic authors, Moore scripted the entire layout for the artist: every panel, background object, and action. Using this absolute control, Moore stretched the comic book medium for all it was worth, filling every panel with references, allusions, and details which pointed to the fullness and complexity of his world. Moore even creates meaning with structure, so that the size, shape, and configuration of panels tell much of the story for him. One of the volumes is even mirrored, so that the first page is almost identical to the last, the second page to the second last, and so on. That most readers don\\'t even notice this is even more remarkable. That means that Moore used an extremely stylized technique so well that it didn\\'t interfere with the story at all.But therein lies the difficulty: if a reader isn\\'t looking for it, they will probably have no idea what makes this books so original and so remarkable. This especially true if they don\\'t know the tropes Moore is subverting, or the allusive history he calls upon to contextualize his ideas.While many readers enjoy the book purely on its artistic merit, the strength of the writing, and the well-paced plot, others disregard the work when they are unable to recognize what makes it revolutionary. One might as well try to read Paradise Lost with no knowledge of the Bible, or watch Looney Toons without a familiarity with 1940\\'s pop culture.It is not a perfect work, but there is no such thing. Moore\\'s lead heroine is unremarkable, which Moore himself has lamented. He did not feel entirely comfortable writing women at that point in his career, and the character was forced on him by the higher ups. Luckily, she\\'s not bad enough to ruin the work, and only stands out because she lacks the depth of his other characters.His politics sometimes run to the anarchic, but often this is just a satire of violence and hubris. Moore gives no easy answers in his grand reimagining. His interlocking stories present many thoughts, and many points of view. In the end, it is up to the reader to decide for himself who was right or wrong--as if anyone truly could be.Moore never insults the intelligence of his readers, and so creates a work with more depth than anyone is likely to plumb even after numerous readings.

      "I can understand why this is considered a holy tome in the field of graphic novels. The plot is complex, it’s unique, and it’s well drawn. Also, it’s got the Holy Grail of every geeky comic book fan's wetdreams – lots of cool gadgets and stuff.I ain’t knocking that. Imagination abounds, and I am thoroughly impressed. I love that comic books and graphic novels create their entire world – but – BUT then again every piece of art creates it’s own world. And ALL OF THOSE OTHER ARTS MAKE EMOTIONALLY ENGAGING STORIES!I get frustrated because my graphic-novel friends keep foisting these things on me. They love me, they see me as very imaginative and very supportive of their creativity, but they cannot seem to get why I go cold at graphic novels.This one was thrust upon me, because I was affected by the movie The Dark Knight. I got emotionally engaged. I felt hopeless with Batman. I got a knot in my stomach when that horrible, unspeakable thing happened two-thirds of the way through the film. I was troubled by Joker’s logic, and I was frustrated with the people in the ferries. In other words, I WAS EMOTIONALLY ENGAGED!A lot of these graphic novels and stuff seem to think that if they simply tickle your creative brain, they’ve succeeded. I want more – I want to laugh and cry and cheer and feel despair. I want a core of true human story. Gadgets and colors and costumes and superpowers don't make me weep or shout or ponder or giggle or sigh. Well, they make me sigh - with frustrationa nd boredom.I know I sound angry at these things. I get frustrated, because I don’t think this is so hard to understand that I need emotional stimulation. And yet, my graphic-novel friends still press these books in my hand, hoping to unlock my wonder and amazement. I was full of wonder and amazement at The Adventures of Kavalier & Clay, a novel about a superhero and the super-human who spawned him. I am not above the magical, mystical, and fantastic (I love Harry Potter), but there has to be more than just gadgetry and explosions. There has to be honesty and the courage to plumb the human experience. I felt terribly at Kavalier’s struggles with violence and anti-Semitism in Eastern Europe. Sam Clay’s secrets were heart-breaking. Kavalier’s search for revenge and Sam’s search for respect were emotionally engaging. In Harry Potter, I rallied behind Mrs. Weasley's maternal drive. I loved Harry's indignance at cruelty. I thought Hermione's concern for elves was sweet, and complicated (who know they wanted to be slaves). Chabon succeeded at making me feel, and so did Rowling. Watchmen did not.Watchmen is about two generations of heroes. One was human – using costumes, strength, and cunning. The next was led bys a superhuman, Dr. Manhattan – they were both human and somewhat superhuman. Then a law was passed making their work illegal, and they went underground. It’s only when someone starts bumping off the old retired heroes that a mystery starts, a mystery that asks the esoteric and totally intellectual (read: unemotional) question of why humans can be drawn to the edge of doom, and what they need to do to stop just at the edge.Oh - for the people who know and love Watchmen - I felt bad for how Dr. Manhattan couldn’t have a human relationship. And I understood why Laurie got infuriated. The thrill of Laurie and Dan becoming superheroes again was honest and wonderful. But that was it – I didn’t feel the panic of the world ending (mostly because if it did happen, there’d be no story). I didn’t care for the casual use of rape as a plot point. None of the long-winded, theoretical discussion about whether humanity was worth saving had any emotional pull to me. I didn’t care. In all 413 pages, I had four honest emotional reactions. One of my reactions was anger at the tangential pirate story (don’t ask – it doesn’t have any emotional or thematic reason for being there – it was just added because someone thought it was cool). Cool. There’s the problem. Cool things don’t make me feel. People can imagine and draw all the cool things in the world, and it won’t make me emotional engage. Cool things don’t make my heart race or break or pause. They leave me cold. Graphic novels are mostly cool.\n",

      "Since the movie came out, I've found myself having to explain why Watchmen is important and interesting. Despite being the most revered comic book of all time, it never really entered the mainstream until the film. Now, people are rushing to read it in droves, but approaching Watchmen without an understanding of its history and influences means missing most of what makes it truly special.The entire work is an exploration of the history and purpose of the superhero genre: how readers connect to it, and what it means philosophically. Moore stretches from fond satire to outright subversion to minute allusion, encasing the once-simple genre in layers of meaning. Even as he refines and compresses the genre, he also constantly pushes its boundaries. Watchmen is unapologetic, unflinching, and most miraculous of all, freed from the shame which binds so many comics.Moore never stoops to making an entirely sympathetic character. There is no real hero, and none of the characters represents Moore's own opinions. Superhero comics are almost always built around wholly sympathetic, admirable characters. They represent what people wish they were, and they do the things normal people wish they could do.It is immediately gratifying escapism, which many people attach themselves to, especially the meek who lead tedious, unfulfilled lives. Many people also do the same thing with celebrities, idolizing them and patterning their own lives on the choices those famous people make. But in this modern age of reality TV and gossip media, we know that celebrities are not ideal people.Indeed, their wealth and prominence often drives them mad. While everyone else views the world from the bottom up, they view it from the top down, and this skewed perspective wreaks havoc with their morality and sense of self. Moore's superheroes represent something even beyond this celebrity. Not only are they on the top of the heap, but they are physically different from other human beings. Their superiority is not just in their heads and pocketbooks, but in their genetics.They are not meant to be sympathetic, they are meant to be human. They are as flawed and conflicted as any of us, and while we may sometimes agree with them, as often, we find them distant and unstable.Many people have fingered Rorschach as the 'hero' of this tale, but that is as flawed as pinning Satan as the hero of 'Paradise Lost'. Following the classic fantasy of power, Rorschach inflicts his morality on the world around him. But, since he is not an ideal, but a flawed human, we recognize that his one-man fascist revolution is unjustified.We all feel that we see the world clearly, and everyone around us is somehow confused and mistaken. Often, we cannot understand how others can possibly think they way they do. Sometimes, we try to communicate, but there is often an impassable barrier between two minds: no matter how much we talk or how pure our intentions, one will never be able to convince the other.We all feel the temptation to act out--if only those disagreeable people were gone, the world would be a better place. While this justification may be enough for most comic writers, Moore realizes that the other guy thinks everything would be better if we were gone. Rorschach lashes out because his ideas are too 'out there' and he is too socially insecure to convince anyone that he is right. He is unwilling to question himself, and so becomes a force of his own violent affirmation.Most who sympathize with him are like him: short-sighted and desperate, unable to communicate with or understand their fellow man. Many are unwilling even to try. Rorschach becomes a satire of the super hero code, which says that as long as you call someone evil, you are justified in beating him to death. This same code is also commonly adopted as foreign policy by leaders in war, which Moore constantly reminds us of with references to real world politics.The rest of the characters take on other aspects of violent morality, with varying levels of self-righteousness. Like the British government of the 1980's, which inspired Moore, or the American government of the beginning of this century, we can see that equating physical power with moral power is both flawed and dangerous. Subjugating others 'for their own good' is only a justification for leaders who feel entitled to take what they can by force.The only character with the power to really change the world doesn't do so. His point of view is so drastically different from the common man that he sees that resolving such petty squabbles by force won't actually solve anything. It won't put people on the same page, and will only create more conflict and inequality. Dr. Manhattan sees man only as a tiny, nearly insignificant part of the vast complexity of the cosmos. Though he retains some of his humanity, his perspective is so remote that he sees little justification for interference, any more than you or I would crush the ants of one colony to promote the other.The ending presents another example of one man trying to enforce his moral solutions upon the entire world. Not only does this subvert the role of the super hero throughout comic book history, but reflects upon the political themes touched on throughout the book. Man is already under the subjugation of men--they may not be superhuman, but still hold the lives of countless billions in their hands. It is no coincidence that Moore shows us president Nixon, a compulsive liar and paranoid delusional who ran the most powerful country in the world as he saw fit.Moore's strength as a writer--even more than creating flawed, human characters--is telling many different stories, which are really the same story told in different ways, all layered over each other. Each story then comments on the others, presenting many views. His plots are deceptively complex, but since they all share themes, they flow one into the next with an effortlessness that marks Moore as a truly sophisticated writer.Many readers probably read right across the top of this story, flowing smoothly from one moment to the next, and never even recognizing the bustling philosophical exploration that moves the whole thing along. The story-within-a-story 'The Black Freighter' winds itself through the whole of Watchmen, and for Moore, serves several purposes. Firstly, it is another subversion of comic book tropes: Moore is tapping into the history of the genre, when books about pirates, cowboys, spacemen, monsters, and teen love filled the racks next to the superhuman heroes before that variety was obliterated by the Comics Code (yet another authoritarian act of destruction by people who thought they were morally superior). But in the world of Watchmen, there are real superheroes, and they are difficult, flawed, politically motivated, and petty. So, superhero comics are unpopular in the Watchmen world, because there, superheroes are fraught with political and moral complexity. These are not the requisite parts of an escapist romp. We don't have comic books about our politicians, after all. We may have political satire, but that's hardly escapist fun.So, instead they read about pirates. Beyond referencing the history of comics, 'The Black Freighter' works intertextually with Watchmen. The themes and events of one follow the other, and the transitions between them create a continuous exploration of ideas. Moore never breaks off his story, because even superficially unrelated scenes flow from one to the other, in a continuous, multilayered, self-referential narrative.I continually stand in awe of Moore's ability to connect such disparate threads. Many comic authors since have tried to do the same, but from Morrison to Ellis to Ennis, they have shown that striking that right balance is one of the hardest things an author can do. Most of Moore's followers end up with an unpalatable mish-mash instead of a carefully prepared and seasoned dish.Unlike most comic authors, Moore scripted the entire layout for the artist: every panel, background object, and action. Using this absolute control, Moore stretched the comic book medium for all it was worth, filling every panel with references, allusions, and details which pointed to the fullness and complexity of his world. Moore even creates meaning with structure, so that the size, shape, and configuration of panels tell much of the story for him. One of the volumes is even mirrored, so that the first page is almost identical to the last, the second page to the second last, and so on. That most readers don't even notice this is even more remarkable. That means that Moore used an extremely stylized technique so well that it didn't interfere with the story at all.But therein lies the difficulty: if a reader isn't looking for it, they will probably have no idea what makes this books so original and so remarkable. This especially true if they don't know the tropes Moore is subverting, or the allusive history he calls upon to contextualize his ideas.While many readers enjoy the book purely on its artistic merit, the strength of the writing, and the well-paced plot, others disregard the work when they are unable to recognize what makes it revolutionary. One might as well try to read Paradise Lost with no knowledge of the Bible, or watch Looney Toons without a familiarity with 1940's pop culture.It is not a perfect work, but there is no such thing. Moore's lead heroine is unremarkable, which Moore himself has lamented. He did not feel entirely comfortable writing women at that point in his career, and the character was forced on him by the higher ups. Luckily, she's not bad enough to ruin the work, and only stands out because she lacks the depth of his other characters.His politics sometimes run to the anarchic, but often this is just a satire of violence and hubris. Moore gives no easy answers in his grand reimagining. His interlocking stories present many thoughts, and many points of view. In the end, it is up to the reader to decide for himself who was right or wrong--as if anyone truly could be.Moore never insults the intelligence of his readers, and so creates a work with more depth than anyone is likely to plumb even after numerous readings. Likewise, he does not want you to 'hold on for the ride', but expects that you will engage and question and try to come to terms with his work, yourself. No one is necessarily the hero or villain, and many people find themselves cowed and unsure of such an ambiguous world, just as we do with the real world.Watchmen is not instructional, nor is it simply a romp. This book, like all great books, is a journey that you and the author share. The work is meant to connect us to the real world, and not to let us escape from it. This is Moore's greatest subversion of the superhero genre, and does even more than Milton to \"justify the ways of God to man\", for many men delude themselves to godhood, yet even these gods cannot escape their fundamental humanity.\n",

To my credit they did a killer job with the movie - not only did they stick flypaper close to the source material, they also directed the scenes with finesse and had a near perfect cast. So I\\'ve seen the movie a lot before reading this cerebral-stimulating story about questionable heroes who are only realistic because they\\'re questionable. That didn\\'t damper my enjoyment at all, the story is too good for it to.\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003eIf you don\\'t know the story yet, that\\'s a sad thing because this story rocks. A colorful cast of miscreants and worshiped idols blend together to make the former - and future? - watchmen. Is it irony or simply sensible that the ones who, at the end, stand by their unbending moral compasses are the ones who are the outcasts and who prefer staying in the shadow of humanity\\'s eye, and that the heroes in the limelight are the ones who bask in their twisted salvation plan without question?\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003eWatchmen mixes more than interesting characters together - it blends genres: a dark, noir mystery in Rorschach\\'s investigations; the embrace of science-fiction and higher-function fantasy through Dr Manhattan; gritty slaps of the American dream confronting brutality in war via the Comedian; age-old hero worship and public adoration of select figures. Blend it all and what do you get? Bliss in book (and cinema) form.\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003e\\\\u003cb\\\\u003e“There\\'s a notion I\\'d like to see buried: the ordinary person. Ridiculous. There is no ordinary person.” \\\\u003c/b\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003eCharacter wise, Rorschach is my favorite. His serious and impatient ADD conversations with Daniel are winners. For some reason the blue Manhattan doesn\\'t ring my bell nearly as much, and am I the only one who found the Silk Spectre more bratty than interesting? The story isn\\'t about day-old accepted superhero stereotypes, but flawed beings who bounce their divergences against each other. Manhattan is a little bit of Superman, the king of the city, ultra powerful but now other, working with the people but distant from them. The director said when making the movie that Nite Owl was like batman who couldn\\'t get it up. Blend him with Roschach\\'s detective skills, and a little bit of Batman does come to mind. It\\'s sort of like blending beloved heroes with shifty but loved villains to get familiar but completely new creations.\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003eOn the downside, I didn\\'t like the comic interference in book OR movie form. Even if the book had it easier to digest in interludes, I still wish it wasn\\'t there. I\\'m sure an artsy and relevant thing was being done with it, but I hate distractions. Some of the in betweens were cool additions, but some of it was rather boring. I think it would have worked better to have these features at the end as add-on bonuses - be awed by the story, then dive into extra goodies to spice up the experience.\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003eAlso, artwork was rather lacking. They had only so much room to work with, of course, tons going on, and the faded washed effect works on a psychological level considering the time period and storyline, but there\\'s little oomph and glory compared to some other graphic novel works. \\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003eAt the beginning, the story asks you to ponder, \\\\\"Who is watching the watchmen?\\\\\" By the close of the story, you\\'re still pondering the same question.\\\\u003c/span\\\\u003e\\\\n  \\\\u003ca data-text-id=\\\\\"6635180187344526191\\\\\" href=\\\\\"#\\\\\" onclick=\\\\\"swapContent($(this));;

Onward, to the review! \\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003eI was curious about this one, and everyone seems to love it. I really liked it at first, but then towards the middleish/end, I got a mite impatient and just wanted to get to the end already. The comic-within-a-comic thing, while I get the metaphor, was trying to my patience. I probably missed most of the significance about those sections, honestly. And the bit about the comic artist, which I *cough* skimmed. \\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003eRegarding the characters, my favorite was Rorschach. Probably not surprising, but I loved him. He was just plain fascinating. I loved that he had his own internal moral compass and followed it no matter what. I liked that he found purpose in his life, and if his methods were a bit brusque, well... Life\\'s a bitch when you rape or murder. Sometimes it catches up to you. S\\'all I\\'m sayin\\'. \\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003eI really, really did not like Laurie. I kinda wanted Rorschach to kill her. I mean, maybe accidentally, but... no. Eff that, kill her in a fit of anger, Ror. She insulted you 50 times too many. Do it. Make the world a better place.\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003eSeriously, she irritated the hell right out of me. I am free of hell because she irritated me so much that *poof* - there it went. Can you GET any fucking whinier?? \\\\\"Oh, my metaphysical super-hero genius blue boyfriend is being meta. Booo hooo hoooo.\\\\\" STFU. For reals. Jon should have left her ass on Mars, sans breathing aura. Sorry, Mars. \\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003eAlso, while I\\'m on the subject of dumbshit characters, what the hell was with Ror\\'s psychiatrist? Umm, in what world do you think that someone who uses a constantly shifting Rorschach test as their mask to face society is NOT manipulating you regarding his responses to a Rorschach test? Oooh, you\\'re so clever... I bet he never saw it coming that you\\'d use HIS IDENTITY to try to get him to reveal himself. A butterfly! He\\'s making progress! Yay! Little wonder Doc started a downward spiral... I mean honestly, what other outcome could there possibly have been?\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003eAnd furthermore, I\\'m surprised he didn\\'t start down a homicidal spiral starting with murdering his shrieking harpy of a wife. Hmm... Let\\'s see, there\\'s someone in need of help. \\\\\"Don\\'t you DARE help them. You stand here and listen to me dictate the terms of our relationship! Terms: You agree to be a complete submissive doormat and avoid any work more challenging than cleaning up puppyshit for the rest of eternity, or I leave you.\\\\\" Gee... where to sign? \\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003eI get the illustration of the dichotomy between those who will do something to help and those who turn away, or worse, hurt. I get it. But really, that was too much. \\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003eOtherwise, I mostly liked this. There were bits that I thought were pure genius, and bits that I thought were metaphorically tedious, and parts that I thought were just plain tedious (*cough* Laurie*). But overall, I liked it. And I\\'m glad that I read it, finally. \\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003eUmm... that\\'s all I got. 29 minutes ago it was time for bed. In 15 minutes I will still be up anyway. :P\\\\u003c/span\\\\u003e\\\\n  \\\\u003ca data-text-id=\\\\\"1445865251792578408\\\\\" href=\\\\\"#\\\\\" onclick=\\\\\"swapContent($(this));; return

In case you’ve missed the movie and the comics and the book and all the scads and scads of hoopla surrounding it all, \\\\u003ci\\\\u003eWatchmen\\\\u003c/i\\\\u003e is an alternate history graphic novel that takes place in 1980s New York City. It’s pretty bleak days, on the brink of nuclear war, and for a few generations, people have been stepping out at night in silly getups to play at being superheroes. Many of the “Watchmen” are caricatures of famous comic-book heroes (which everyone knows more about than me, so I’ll just leave it there). The point is, people got mad because what’s really the difference between someone taking justice into their own hands and vigilantism? Not a lot, I guess. And so being a self-appointed superhero has been outlawed, and this is the story of a handful of people who used to be Watchmen and how they’ve adjusted (or not) to civilian life. Oh and also there’s Dr. Manhattan, the only one who actually \\\\u003ci\\\\u003eis\\\\u003c/i\\\\u003e a superhero, as in he has real powers, and is not really very human anymore, and so is his own kind of basket case. \\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003eThat’s enough. Probably everyone already knew all that; even \\\\u003ci\\\\u003eI\\\\u003c/i\\\\u003e knew, at least partially, what I was in for when I picked this up. And I will admit that I wasn’t very optimistic going in; after being very disappointed with the totally dated, confusing, and uninspiring \\\\u003ci\\\\u003eDark Knight Returns\\\\u003c/i\\\\u003e, I had assumed that I just wasn’t going to be very excited by more masked crusaders and their moral dilemmas. But—and let’s have a big collective “Duh” here, please—\\\\u003ci\\\\u003eWatchmen\\\\u003c/i\\\\u003e is so totally different. \\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003eIt’s a really difficult book—emotionally, situationally, morally, ethically, graphically, everything-ly. A lot of it is hard to stomach, from the overt gore and horror and despair to the trickier emotional backtracking and ethical ambiguity. I was especially fascinated by the book’s mind-bendingly complex morality, forcing constant second-guessings of flimsy concepts like “good” and “bad.” And the characters, oh my god, these intensely real, consistent, and consistently surprising characters! There’s Rorschach, the only Watchman who refused to retire, whose plaintive morality is so heartbreaking. He is so sure, so rigid, and so \\\\u003ci\\\\u003eright\\\\u003c/i\\\\u003e, but so what? That doesn’t matter if you’re dead. And there’s squeaky-clean Adrian, formerly Ozymandias, hero turned villain turned hero again, maybe, sort of, if glorified ends justify despicable means. And then Sally, once the Silk Spectre, the first Watchman to retire, whose entire life is an endless bitter argument with herself, hating the man she loves and hating herself for loving him. The breadth and development of \\\\u003ci\\\\u003eall\\\\u003c/i\\\\u003e the characters was breathtaking. The only stereotypical, cardboard, one-dimensional face in the bunch was Laurie—daughter of Sally, girlfriend of Dr. Manhattan, and former dabbler in superherodom—but more on her later.\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003eGetting beyond the intricate plot and multifaceted characters—essential components to any fine work of literature—let’s talk about what makes this not only a phenomenal book, but a phenomenal \\\\u003ci\\\\u003ecomic\\\\u003c/i\\\\u003e book. Whenever anyone asked me why I was so impressed with it, I started babbling about how jaw-droppingly meticulously \\\\u003ci\\\\u003econstructed\\\\u003c/i\\\\u003e it is. This is something that, stupidly, I hadn’t yet considered about graphic novels. As a proofreader, I know a thing or two about line-breaks and the physical components of (prose) book design, like how you always have to start a chapter on a recto page, or how you’re not allowed to have one lone line of text at the top of an otherwise blank page. And with a graphic novel I’d just assumed that you drew the pictures you needed to get the story where you wanted it to go. But no way; there is \\\\u003ci\\\\u003eso\\\\u003c/i\\\\u003e much more to think about! What do you do if you only have, say, twelve panels worth of story, but you need to fill eighteen so that you can have a full-page spread next? In prose, if you have a short line, you can squinch the paragraph before it to fit it all in, and I guess you could do that with drawings too, but that seems like a much dicier proposition. What I’m trying to say is that \\\\u003ci\\\\u003eWatchmen\\\\u003c/i\\\\u003e made me much much more aware of the mechanics of putting a graphic novel together—not in a bad way, and not in a way that took me out of the story, but in an awestruck way, where every time I noticed two parallel storylines subtly or overtly augmenting each other, I was amazed anew by how much work must have gone into every aspect of the planning and execution of this tome. \\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003eThis was most striking in sections that had two stories being simultaneously told, alternating panel by panel. For example, in one such double scene we have Laurie walking through a back alley with Dan (formerly a Watchman named Night Owl, currently drying Laurie’s adorable tears as she decides whether to break up with Dr. Manhattan) when they are surrounded by a group of muggers. At the same time, Dr. Manhattan is being interviewed live on ABC News. So watch this: A reporter asks Dr. Manhattan, “Doc, if the Reds act up in Afghanistan, will you be prepared to enter hostilities?”—just as the thugs draw their weapons on Laurie and Dan. Then another reporter tells Dr. Manhattan that one of his colleagues recently died of cancer, and he says, “I believe it was quite \\\\u003ci\\\\u003esudden\\\\u003c/i\\\\u003e and quite \\\\u003ci\\\\u003epainful\\\\u003c/i\\\\u003e”—just as Laurie and Dan turn on their attackers and start breaking bones. Next Dr. Manhattan starts getting upset, and as his handlers try to rush him out of the auditorium, one tells the crowd, “Sorry about this, folks, but the show’s \\\\u003ci\\\\u003eover\\\\u003c/i\\\\u003e”—just as Dan and Laurie look around and see all the would-be muggers laid out on the ground. See what he did there? Incredible.\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003eBut you’re not listening to me because I’m an art critic, right? You’re listening to me because I’m a girl reading graphic novels from a non-fanboy perspective, and because I’m purportedly writing these essays from a feminist slant. So let me bring it back to Laurie. Throughout the book, I found her simpering, insipid, self-absorbed. In a work full of complicated, original characters, I felt like she stood alone as a cardboard, clichéd, brainless-but-hot whiny bimbette. I couldn’t believe that everyone was in love with her, that she was the one on whom it fell to save the world, that Dr. Manhattan’s love for her was ultimately the single thing that would bring him back to earth to try to avert war. I don’t think Alan Moore has a very high opinion of women generally (at least how they’re painted in \\\\u003ci\\\\u003eWatchmen\\\\u003c/i\\\\u003e), but his portrayal of Laurie as a vacant silly sex symbol bothered me like crazy. \\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003eBut then a strange thing happened, just now, in fact. I’ve been putting off writing this review for days, and I still just couldn’t do it, so I figured of course I’d think more clearly after a cigarette break’s worth of rereading the book. And the scene I randomly opened to was \\\\u003ci\\\\u003ethat\\\\u003c/i\\\\u003e one, the pivotal one: Laurie and Dr. Manhattan on Mars, where she tries to convince him to save the world by talking whinily about that one time when she got really drunk and yelled at Blake (the slimy fucker who once raped her mother) and threw a drink in his face. And I read it again, for probably the fifth time this month, and I waited for all the righteous feminist anger about her silliness and stupidity to come back, but then…it just didn’t. \\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003eFor the first time I kind of \\\\u003ci\\\\u003egot\\\\u003c/i\\\\u003e why she would bring up those things; I kind of saw how she’s not \\\\u003ci\\\\u003eactually\\\\u003c/i\\\\u003e clichéd, really; she’s very true to the character she’s been given. I don’t \\\\u003ci\\\\u003elike\\\\u003c/i\\\\u003e her, but I don’t like Blake or Dan so much either. I think I’d confused myself, wanting so badly for the book to include an intelligent, noble female character that I insisted Laurie was badly \\\\u003ci\\\\u003ewritten\\\\u003c/i\\\\u003e, when really she’s just someone I find distasteful and a bit of a letdown. So what I mean is, yet again Alan Moore did a fantastic job of creating a nuanced, complicated, realistic character, who acted consistently with the way she’d been created to act. She’s messy and selfish and preening, but that’s who she is. Just one more astonishing aspect of this completely astonishing book. Just one more reason why it’s upsetting, disturbing, challenging, and, yeah, brilliant.\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003e***\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003e(before reading: Well, most of the issues I had with the movie (disregarding the cheesy, over-dramatically delivered lines and bad acting) were plot concerns, so I\\'m interested to see whether the book does a better job of things.

Scared the heck out of me--until that moment I had gone about my blissful childhood with the belief that, no matter how stupid man might be, at least he couldn\\'t destroy the world. To find out man now possessed a power I had previously only attributed to God\\'s domain was frightening stuff. \\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003eAlso, I enjoyed the inventive twist on the superhero. There\\'s only one true superhero in the book--Dr. Manhattan. The rest are masked vigilantes who, after the advent of comic books, just decide to take up cape and hood and battle crime. They are not invincible and they are not immune to human frailties--physically or emotionally. Moore really uses this to explore the psychology behind the desire to be a superhero (one that we probably all harbor at some point and time in our lives, if only as mere fantasy) and explore America\\'s heritage of vigilante justice.\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003eNow I shall anxiously await the movie, though I doubt it will live up to the book\\'s impact. I\\'m also curious to see if they\\'ll remain true to the book\\'s ending . . . the one aspect with which I had a few (very few) qualms.\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003eUpdate: The movie was crap. Well cast, but I agree with Alan Moore that some stories can only be told in a particular medium. This is one of them. In translating it to the screen, the result was a fragmented mess. Bloated and lumbering along for nearly three hours, the movie made the mistake of trying to pack in too much. For the most part, it was well cast (although I didn\\'t like Silk Spectre II or Ozymandias, but the actors playing Rorschach, Nite Owl II, and the Comedian are perfect). And I felt like I\\'d wandered into a Smurf nudist colony for a third of the movie (it\\'s true to the book and I don\\'t have a problem with it, but it was just weird). Just read it, savor it, and avoid the movie. \\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003e\\\\u003c/span\\\\u003e\\\\n  \\\\u003ca data-text-id=\\\\\"899798236580665954\\\\\" href=\\\\\"#\\\\\"

Everybody apparently. This book—or comic book, or graphic novel, or whatever you want to call it—has been picked apart endlessly in the 20 years since it was first published, every frame microscopically studied, its plot, characters, and symbols charted out no less elaborately than Ulysses’. Its fans, like fans of everything else, are intensely protective and argumentative. Reading a book like this now, for the first time, is likely to result less in actual criticism than in intellectual alignment. What can be said has likely been said; the issue now is with whom do you agree.\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003eSo on the occasion of DC Comics’ Absolute Watchmen, a beautifully re-mastered anniversary edition with hard-to-find scripts from writer Alan Moore and sketches from artist Dave Gibbons, I’ll agree with everybody and nobody, the geeks and the eye-rollers both. You say I contradict myself? Very well then, but Watchmen contains multitudes: It’s big and important and brilliant and insufferable. It’s mythic; it’s gritty. It’s awesome and it’s dumb. In its pages are heroes, anti-heroes, and giant, blue-peckered superheroes. There are aliens, street-fighting lesbians, and pirates. There are ambiguously evil geniuses and average New Yorkers. When its violence isn’t intimate, it’s global. When the sex isn’t tender, it’s dirty. Watchmen’s story is part whodunit, part philosophical tract, its writing fierce and groundbreaking, pinched and pedantic. The art is always stiff and always utterly appropriate.\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003e\\\\u003ca href=\\\\\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/472331.Watchmen\\\\\" title=\\\\\"Watchmen by Alan Moore\\\\\" rel=\\\\\"nofollow\\\\\"\\\\u003eWatchmen\\\\u003c/a\\\\u003e is everything.

Some of them featured complete short stories in each issue. The better ones, however, were those serialized stories or novellettes. Issues were delivered weekly by boat from the mainland (Wednesdays for Aliwan komiks, Thursdays for Wakasan komiks, etc.), each story cut off in each issue at a most suspenseful moment, so that after reading one, I\\'ll have exactly a week tossing and turning in bed at night, daydreaming by day, thinking of what\\'ll happen next to my favorite character. Then exactly the same day of the week, the week after, I would already be on high alert when the tide is high by noontime or mid-afternoon, with the few centavos of rent money for these komiks, money I\\'ve either stolen from my grandfather\\'s pocket or saved from my school allownce, racing with the other addicted kids (and adults) towards the small stores renting out these literary delights, eager to read the latest installments of the stories we were hooked into.\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003eI remember one, about a boy chess genius named Alejandro. The suspense is often doubled here: suspense not only in the story itself, but also in the crucial positions over the chess board where Alejandro would always seem to be on the verge of losing yet would always manage to uncork some magical combinations, save himself with difficult creeping moves, or by some deft positional maneuverings, all always revealed in the next issue. Made me always salivate for what comes next.\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003eCompared with these komiks of long ago, \\\\\"Watchmen\\\\\" (my first full-length graphic novel) is far superior in many ways: excellent graphics by Dave Gibbons in expensive, glossy paper, great story which starts with retired superheroes mysteriously dying one-by-one, a complete meal of action, suspense, love story, sex, violence, killings (half of New York City\\'s population dead plus some more), each character with an entire psychological profile (not just Murakami characters popping out from nowhere), profound, apt killer quotes from sources as diverse as Elvis Costello, C.G. Jung (\\\\\"As far as we can discern, the sole purpose of human existence is to kindle a light of meaning in the darkness of mere being.\\\\\"), to William Blake (\\\\\"Tyger, Tyger burning bright, In the forests of the night, What immortal hand or eye could frame thy fearful symmetry?\\\\\")--a feast for the eyes and mind of an exuberant youth.\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003eObviously, however, this novel did not come to me at the proper time. Like the freshest Playboy centerfold model offering herself to you in all her naked glory when you are already old, impotent, with a sagging body racked by stage 4 diabetes mellitus. What can you do with her? You can\\'t even lick her as her sweetness would surely kill you.\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003eHow, indeed, at my age, can Alan Moore still excite me with these costumed martial arts experts, rich guys with high-tech weapons and this radiation man Jon, always naked, can multiply himself to have a sex orgy of two or more of him with a girl, and who doesn\\'t age or die? Is Alan Moore saying that this is what happens to men who die in the state of grace and go to heaven? Or is this author just mocking old readers like me?\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003eIn the finall analysis there simply wasn\\'t enough orgies here and too late, too late have I known thee,

None of them besides the blue guy have superpowers so it\\'s basically a group of guys who like a punch up and dress up in rubbish outfits. One bloke even has butterfly wings!! I realise that\\'s the point, to show these \\\\\"superheroes\\\\\" up as socio/psychopaths and hiding from their own lives, but you could do it in a more interesting way and still explain why the government chose to send these heroes out to Vietnam. \\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003eRorsharch isn\\'t grim, he\\'s a sad bastard trying too hard to, well, look hard. He\\'s not hard, he\\'s a c***. Comedian is a psychopath but so what? He\\'s a one dimensional prick who deserved what he got on page 1. There\\'s someone killing \\\\\"superheroes\\\\\". Good. They\\'re either idiots, hopeless has beens, or sadistic gimps who ought to have been put down years ago, never mind write a book about them.\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003eWhat else? The blue guy gets dumped so goes off to mope on Mars. Really. There are also cut scenes, \\\\\"Under the Hood\\\\\" the dullest autobiography of an ex-superhero ever penned thanks to Moore\\'s substandard prose, and \\\\\"The Black Freighter\\\\\" a sub par haunted pirate comic book. The main character of that story floats about until going mad then lands and kills his wife. That story is stretched out over the entire length of the book. \\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003eSo you have a murder plot that I didn\\'t care about, characters you wouldn\\'t think about twice, two sub plots that never should have been, and a culmination which, despite my criticisms of the book, I quite liked in its randomness. Though it does seem like Moore went off his meds and thought \\\\\"ah who cares anymore, this\\'ll do\\\\\". \\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003eGibbon\\'s artwork is what makes this book. His work throughout is of a high standard while his period designs of \\\\\"The Black Freighter\\\\\" sequences are brilliant. \\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003eThere are loads more I could say about this. Dated, dismal, unimaginative really. I cannot see what others see and to be honest the people I\\'ve met who have read this didn\\'t see it either. I guess most of them just couldn\\'t be bothered to write a 1 star review just like they couldn\\'t, like me, finish the book. I tried twice too and I love comics. Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson have done a brilliant series on the themes in this book, called \\\\\"The Boys\\\\\". Check that out instead of this absolute junk. Avoid this load of toss and anyone who tells you different. \\\\u003c/span\\\\u003e\\\\n  \\\\u003ca data-text-id=\\\\\"5021599506837220253\\\\\" href=\\\\\"#\\\\\"

I don\\'t remember who. They still have it, I\\'m pretty sure. If you are that friend, please return my book because I\\'ve just seen the movie and now I\\'m ready to read the book again.\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003eMy friends and I were so damn obsessed when this series was first coming out. It was a monthly serial, of course, but the issues kept coming later and later. Fortunately there was so very much detail to obsess over in every single issue. The symbols, the allusions, the fearful symmetry, the backstory, the subplots, etc, etc. \\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003eThat experience -- having to wait a month for the next chapter of the book you\\'re utterly consumed by -- is something I miss today. Certainly Dickens wrote that way, serialized as he was in the London newspapers. And I see attempts at serialization from time to time, in weekly entertainment magazines or online. But there\\'s something juicier about a comic book, something easier to pick up in the middle and get excited about. Maybe it\\'s the built-in expectation that there\\'s been 300 past issues already, and 300 more to come, so you don\\'t expect to understand everything right away. But also, each issue of Watchmen was a dense, beautiful read. Alan Moore is just brilliant.\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003eIt was interesting to see, in the film, just how much of Moore\\'s dialogue works and doesn\\'t work when actors have to say it. For the most part, it\\'s genius. The whole section with Rorshach and the Big Figure in prison is filmed almost precisely word-for-word from what Moore wrote, and it absolutely kills. So hard-boiled!\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003eI still suspect that there\\'s a kind of person -- women, maybe? -- who just won\\'t ever enjoy any superhero story, no matter how meta or decon or deep it may be. Yes, it\\'s silly and juvenile and ultraviolent, even when it\\'s self-conscious and critical of itself. But for graphic novel fans, Watchmen is the shit. \\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003eThe only negative thing I could say about Watchmen is that it ruined comics for me. Or else I grew up. Probably both happened at the same time. Once something this interesting and deep entered my mental bookrack, Todd McFarlane started looking reeeeeeely stupid. I hoovered up all the Alan Moore I could find, as well as Neil Gaiman, Garth Ennis and Frank Miller, and I did find some great stuff, yes, but in shorter and shorter supply. In comic shops I\\'d rifle through reams of guns, tits, explosions, talking animals and speed lines, looking for some really good writing. It\\'s damn hard to find in comics. I eventually switched to \\'zines.\\\\u003c/span\\\\u003e\\\\n  \\\\u003ca data-text-id=\\\\\"12806779902158583632\\\\\" href=\\\\\"#\\\\\" onclick=\\\\\"swapContent($(this));; return

I will say that I find the popularity and praise I\\'ve seen for this sad. I have read all the arguments that \\\\\"happy endings\\\\\" are passe\\' and over done.

They show, for just a few seconds the Outer Limits on a television screen. The basic plot behind this book is the plot (or the same as the plot)of an Outer Limits episode titled \\\\\"The Architects of Fear\\\\\". The only difference is that at least the poor schmuck who dies in the Outer Limits was a volunteer. Oh, and there was only one death...not millions (or billions?), who didn\\'t volunteer. \\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003eBut hey...the fascist ideal of the end justifies the means seems to be what the writers expect to be the norm for humans...or even the best that can be expected.

A los últimos capítulos se da a conocer mas sobre su pasado y sus inicios como vigilante (me recordó mucho a Frank Castle/The Punisher y su representación en la s2 de Daredevil) lo que mas destacó para mi es su convicción y determinación, a ser fiel en lo que cree, hasta el final.

Instead of reading them then I was a pretty loyal Marvel fan at the time, and the little bit of money I had, which all went to buying comic books, was spent on the Marvel universe, with my forays into DC land coming a few years later when I realized that Batman was just as much fun to read as Daredevil. My main comic book obsession at the time when \\\\u003ci\\\\u003eWatchmen\\\\u003c/i\\\\u003e would have come out was the already mentioned Daredevil, and more specifically the Frank Miller issues, which at the time I didn\\'t realize were the work of one writer, but that\\'s because I never bothered to care about who was writing it, I just knew that the comics from the early 80\\'s were the best ones. \\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003eMoving to the present day I finally decided to read this because I was going to see the movie. I had never wanted to read \\\\u003ci\\\\u003eWatchmen\\\\u003c/i\\\\u003e. I didn\\'t care for the artwork too much, and frankly anything with the blurbs that came on the front and back covers that this has I know would have my critical sensors on full blast, and most likely I would be looking to not like it. On the plus side there is a lot in this graphic novel, it\\'s really a quite intricate story with subplots and allusions and all kinds of ducking and weaving going on that make it dare I say a piece of literature. On the negative side all of the stuff about in depth psychology that is touted isn\\'t really all that groundbreaking here, for proof I point to the Frank Miller run of Daredevil, especially the Elektra story arc, and to the sort of coming out concurrently with \\\\u003ci\\\\u003eWatchmen\\\\u003c/i\\\\u003e Born Again story arc. I\\'ll admit though that there is an intricacy missing to the Miller stories that are here in Moore\\'s. \\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003eShould I even mention the movie? I have to say that I liked the movie just about as much as I liked the book. I thought there were failings, but I thought there were failings in the book. Most of what was silly in the movie came right out of the book, having finished the book the morning I saw the movie much of the dialog from the book was still fresh in my mind, and the for the most part the cringe worthy lines in the movie came right from the text. Was the movie kind of dull at times? Sure, but so is the book. Both are super hero stories devoid of much action. I thought it was faithful to the book, and I think that many people who disagree are probably long time fans of Moore, and have idolized the graphic novel into something more than it really is. I have a theory of Moore\\'s fans that they love what he did at one point so much that they are now extremely negative towards any and all adaptations just because they don\\'t want to realize the shortcomings in the original works. I personally don\\'t really have much of an opinion on the man, I think that he\\'s not a genius, and that there is something really flawed in a man who spends twenty years working on a project where famous little girl literary characters get fucked a lot. That to me seems like a worse artistic decision than anything the director did to \\\\u003ci\\\\u003eWatchmen\\\\u003c/i\\\\u003e.\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003eI\\'m still tempted to come up with a list of a hundred books written in English since 1923 that are better than \\\\u003ci\\\\u003eWatchmen\\\\u003c/i\\\\u003e, but I really have some other things I should be doing so that will have to be put off indefinitely. \\\\u003c/span\\\\u003e\\\\n  \\\\u003ca data-text-id=\\\\\"5659056550900694510\\\\\" href=\\\\\"#\\\\\" onclick=\\\\\"swapContent($(this));; return

বিভিন্ন পত্রিকার কলাম, নিউজ পেপার ক্লিপিং, পুলিশ চার্জ শিট, সাক্ষাৎকার এবং রোরশেখ এর ডায়রি যে গুলো সাধারণত মূল স্টোরির বিভিন্ন ব্যাক স্টোরির বর্ণনা অথবা ব্যাখ্যা দেয়ার জন্য ব্যবহার করা হয়েছে।

It juggles with many topics, among which most famously, the humanity of the characters. In a world where even humans struggle to be human - and I mean our own, - heroes are us. Because the Watchmen are not the likes of Captain America, Professor X, or Superman. They are humans who have taken the task of watching over the world. \\\\u003cem\\\\u003eBut who watches the Watchmen?\\\\u003c/em\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr\\\\u003e\\\\u003cimg src=\\\\\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1481713899i/21447256._SX540_.png\\\\\" alt=\\\\\"watchmen-ch1-pg1\\\\\" width=\\\\\"560\\\\\" height=\\\\\"298\\\\\" class=\\\\\"gr-hostedUserImg\\\\\"\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr\\\\u003eIf you have seen the Watchmen movie, you might have been left with the impression that Doctor Manhattan was the hero of this story. Having read the comic book, you might think that it was Rorschach. I would say that there is no hero in this story. It\\'s one full of disturbed, wounded, marginal people, who are trying their best to do what they can about the world they live in. Even the ones who choose to live in denial are not spared the reality of their lack of actions, or the consequences of it.\\\\u003cbr\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr\\\\u003eAnd as wrong as some of the characters might be, all of them are lively. Moore manages to breathe life into them, make them as real as we are, and just as flawed.\\\\u003cbr\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr\\\\u003e\\\\u003cblockquote\\\\u003e\\\\n  \\\\u003cem\\\\u003e\\\\\"The morality of my actions escapes me.\\\\\"\\xa0\\\\u003c/em\\\\u003e\\\\n\\\\u003c/blockquote\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr\\\\u003eAs deep and as intricate the entire book is, the one story that summarizes the whole, is Tales of the Black Freighter. It took me a while to catch on the story, because in the beginning some of the points it was making were still not connected to what was happening between the characters. But once we reached the end, I was mesmerized by the cleverness of this one, seemingly unconnected to the whole, plot line.\\\\u003cbr\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr\\\\u003eThe one element of \\\\u003cstrong\\\\u003eWatchmen\\\\u003c/strong\\\\u003e that should never be overlooked is the fact that this book does not justify our world, or even us, the people in it. It doesn\\'t sugarcoat, and it doesn\\'t go into allegories which cannot be understood. What is special about \\\\u003cstrong\\\\u003eWatchmen\\\\u003c/strong\\\\u003e, in fact, is that it is a two-sided knife. There is much more to it than we can see, and it is still clear, if one has the right mindset. And the mindset is actually crucial to reading Watchmen, as this book is dedicated first and foremost, to us, our morality, and the justifications we give for our actions. Be it that we see life as too inconsequential to bother, or that we hate humanity to bits, and yet we\\'d sacrifice ourselves to save it, or even going beyond that, think that we love it so much that we justify our horrible deeds with other people\\'s well-being and future rewards.\\\\u003cbr\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr\\\\u003eI know that I am taking this review on a more philosophical level, rather than by analyzing the behaviour of the characters, but I rather think that \\\\u003cstrong\\\\u003eWatchmen\\\\u003c/strong\\\\u003e is not really its story, but what the story represents. While there are novels in which you have a beautiful narrative which could mean other things, but it is also important on its own, to me \\\\u003cstrong\\\\u003eWatchmen\\\\u003c/strong\\\\u003e is a different level if ingenuity, which should not be restricted between the panels of drawings.\\\\u003cbr\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr\\\\u003eAnd speaking of the art of \\\\u003cstrong\\\\u003eWatchmen\\\\u003c/strong\\\\u003e, it is, of course, beautiful, realistic, old-fashioned, ever so clever, and, I\\'d like to think, always valid. The symbolism, the creativity, the continuity, even, are undeniably shining bright and unlikely to be overshadowed by another piece of comic book art. I could even admit to not being too aware of Watchmen, until we discussed Alan Moore\\'s amazing descriptions while writing comic books, and how he\\'d go into details about every single part of the picture, to a point where the illustrator would have to but follow the instructions while drawing.\\\\u003cbr\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr\\\\u003eA real must-read!\\\\u003c/span\\\\u003e\\\\n  \\\\u003ca data-text-id=\\\\\"5600463007714463325\\\\\" href=\\\\\"#\\\\\" onclick=\\\\\"swapContent($(this));;

As a child, I read stacks of comic books—Batman, Superman, Super Girl, Spiderman, plus the more traditionally female comics like Archie and Classics Illustrated. We had an enormous stack of comics, which my cousins used to enjoy when they came to visit. But I’m pretty sure that no one at that time considered them to be “literature.”\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003e\\\\u003ci\\\\u003eWatchmen\\\\u003c/i\\\\u003e takes many of the early tropes and turns them on their heads. The costumed “super” heroes are far from being the uncontested good guys that I remember reading about. . Rorschach is arguably a psychopath, holding people to his very strict “letter of the law” standards of justice, not recognizing compassion or extenuating circumstances. The Comedian is cynical from the very start and prefers expediency over the law. Doc Manhattan is the only one who truly possesses what we would consider to be super powers—and they remove him so far from human concerns that he gets distracted by the inner workings of subatomic particles. \\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003eWe are left to wonder (and the characters sometimes discuss) what inspires a person to dress in tights and go out in the dark to fight crime. Are they noble or crazy? Or both? What qualifies them to put themselves forward as crime fighters? I found the women’s participation in this world very disturbing, as they most seem to be playing dress-up, rather than being functioning super heroes and they get pushed to the side as appendages to the men almost immediately.\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003eThe art work is detailed and dark. The story line is shot through with the fallout from the Second World War (when society thought we could tell the good guys from the bad guys) to a Cold War reality where our former allies, the Soviets, are suddenly a huge threat. Underlying the main story line is a comic book story, read by a bystander in the Watchmen’s world—a tale which is maybe even darker and more desperate than the main story line (and very meta). \\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr /\\\\u003eI can certainly appreciate the effort that went into the creation of this volume—the deconstruction of the super hero, the examination of the changes in society, and so on.

Is it because its subject matters - utopia, relative morality and phenomenological existence just to name a few, are too conceptual for such publication? Not really. Moore\\'s \\\\u003ci\\\\u003eFrom Hell \\\\u003c/i\\\\u003e has similar difficulties yet it works out perfectly readable while being abstract. And really, what else other than \\'graphic art\\' can best present an idea as insane as say, a proper justification of the eradication of humanity? (well I\\'m an artist, I\\'m allowed to be arrogant and self-entitled)\\\\u003cbr\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr\\\\u003e\\\\u003cimg src=\\\\\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1380346189i/700659._SX540_.jpg\\\\\" class=\\\\\"gr-hostedUserImg\\\\\"\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr\\\\u003eThe way I see it is that Watchmen, as a graphic novel, just isn\\'t very effective. The interwoven narratives (which I usually skip but not in this case because well I don\\'t know it\\'s getting late arghhh) are far more entertaining than the straightforward, tech-coloured caricatures. Man, Moore should have teamed up with someone who is able to carry the idea to a grander artistic level where the images actually represent the gravity of the text, not just illustrate it. The literary quality of the writing is mind-blowing, but I just can\\'t get over the fact that it COULD have been the most amazing giant dinosaur vs mega unicorn epicness of a comic - if only they had the right graphic format and design. \\\\u003cbr\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr\\\\u003eHonestly, what\\'s happening to contemporary graphic artists? It\\'s a polarisation of \\'super minimalistic postmodernists\\' whom nobody understands or \\'aesthetic skillful portrait of very detailed things\\' whom we all despise out of duty. Watchmen belongs to the latter category, and it\\'s not even that aesthetic if you compare it to other comic artist say David McKean or Ben Templesmith. \\\\u003cbr\\\\u003e\\\\u003cbr\\\\u003eBottom line, I enjoyed it. Skip the drawings if you want to. And despite its moral, I\\'m still going to go ahead with my Lady Vicious costume. \\\\u003c/span\\\\u003e\\\\n  \\\\u003ca data-text-id=\\\\\"16562821729401955193\\\\\" href=\\\\\"#\\\\\"

أول أبطال القصص المصورة - عام 1938 - فقرر أن يكون أول بطل في العالم الحقيقي! وسرعان ما تأثر به رجال آخرين في أنحاء أميركا، وضعوا الأقنعة وحاربوا الجريمة، وسرعان ما حاول بعضهم أن يجمع الأبطال في فريق واحد، وكانت تلك البداية في الأربعينيات. فماذا صار بعد ذلك؟ ما الذي حدث لهؤلاء الأبطال؟ ولمن أتى بعدهم؟ هذا هو ما لا يمكن أبدا اختصاره هنا، ولا حتى في مقال طويل. ربما أكتب يوما عن هذا الكتاب العبقري، وعن الفيلم الرائع المأخوذ عنه بنفس الاسم، لكنني مهما كتبت لن أعطي \\\\\"آلان مور\\\\\" كامل حقه. لأن حق هذا الرجل أن يُقرَأ ويُفهَم. حق هذا الرجل أن يُعامَل كواحد من هؤلاء الأبطال.\\\\u003cbr

Personally, I didn't find it very enjoyable, but I can see why its as lauded as it is. There's a lot going on with this book. Moore employs a lot of symbolism and subtext. <br/><br/>Its cool not to like it. Just because its a classic or well known and loved, doesn't mean you have to love it. Just know that there are legitimate reasons why it makes so many 'best of' lists. :)<a class=\"jsHide hideAction\" href=\"#\">(less)</a></span></span>\n",

       "<span id=\"freeText5893448145973466932\" style=\"display:none\">Since the movie came out, I've found myself having to explain why Watchmen is important and interesting. Despite being the most revered comic book of all time, it never really entered the mainstream until the film. Now, people are rushing to read it in droves, but approaching Watchmen without an understanding of its history and influences means missing most of what makes it truly special.<br/><br/>The entire work is an exploration of the history and purpose of the superhero genre: how readers connect to it, and what it means philosophically. Moore stretches from fond satire to outright subversion to minute allusion, encasing the once-simple genre in layers of meaning. Even as he refines and compresses the genre, he also constantly pushes its boundaries. Watchmen is unapologetic, unflinching, and most miraculous of all, freed from the shame which binds so many comics.<br/><br/>Moore never stoops to making an entirely sympathetic character. There is no real hero, and none of the characters represents Moore's own opinions. Superhero comics are almost always built around wholly sympathetic, admirable characters. They represent what people wish they were, and they do the things normal people wish they could do.<br/><br/>It is immediately gratifying escapism, which many people attach themselves to, especially the meek who lead tedious, unfulfilled lives. Many people also do the same thing with celebrities, idolizing them and patterning their own lives on the choices those famous people make. But in this modern age of reality TV and gossip media, we know that celebrities are not ideal people.<br/><br/>Indeed, their wealth and prominence often drives them mad. While everyone else views the world from the bottom up, they view it from the top down, and this skewed perspective wreaks havoc with their morality and sense of self. Moore's superheroes represent something even beyond this celebrity. Not only are they on the top of the heap, but they are physically different from other human beings. Their superiority is not just in their heads and pocketbooks, but in their genetics.<br/><br/>They are not meant to be sympathetic, they are meant to be human. They are as flawed and conflicted as any of us, and while we may sometimes agree with them, as often, we find them distant and unstable.<br/><br/>Many people have fingered Rorschach as the 'hero' of this tale, but that is as flawed as pinning Satan as the hero of 'Paradise Lost'. Following the classic fantasy of power, Rorschach inflicts his morality on the world around him. But, since he is not an ideal, but a flawed human, we recognize that his one-man fascist revolution is unjustified.<br/><br/>We all feel that we see the world clearly, and everyone around us is somehow confused and mistaken. Often, we cannot understand how others can possibly think they way they do. Sometimes, we try to communicate, but there is often an impassable barrier between two minds: no matter how much we talk or how pure our intentions, one will never be able to convince the other.<br/><br/>We all feel the temptation to act out--if only those disagreeable people were gone, the world would be a better place. While this justification may be enough for most comic writers, Moore realizes that the other guy thinks everything would be better if we were gone. Rorschach lashes out because his ideas are too 'out there' and he is too socially insecure to convince anyone that he is right. He is unwilling to question himself, and so becomes a force of his own violent affirmation.<br/><br/>Most who sympathize with him are like him: short-sighted and desperate, unable to communicate with or understand their fellow man. Many are unwilling even to try. Rorschach becomes a satire of the super hero code, which says that as long as you call someone evil, you are justified in beating him to death. This same code is also commonly adopted as foreign policy by leaders in war, which Moore constantly reminds us of with references to real world politics.<br/><br/>The rest of the characters take on other aspects of violent morality, with varying levels of self-righteousness. Like the British government of the 1980's, which inspired Moore, or the American government of the beginning of this century, we can see that equating physical power with moral power is both flawed and dangerous. Subjugating others 'for their own good' is only a justification for leaders who feel entitled to take what they can by force.<br/><br/>The only character with the power to really change the world doesn't do so. His point of view is so drastically different from the common man that he sees that resolving such petty squabbles by force won't actually solve anything. It won't put people on the same page, and will only create more conflict and inequality. Dr. Manhattan sees man only as a tiny, nearly insignificant part of the vast complexity of the cosmos. Though he retains some of his humanity, his perspective is so remote that he sees little justification for interference, any more than you or I would crush the ants of one colony to promote the other.<br/><br/>The ending presents another example of one man trying to enforce his moral solutions upon the entire world. Not only does this subvert the role of the super hero throughout comic book history, but reflects upon the political themes touched on throughout the book. Man is already under the subjugation of men--they may not be superhuman, but still hold the lives of countless billions in their hands. It is no coincidence that Moore shows us president Nixon, a compulsive liar and paranoid delusional who ran the most powerful country in the world as he saw fit.<br/><br/>Moore's strength as a writer--even more than creating flawed, human characters--is telling many different stories, which are really the same story told in different ways, all layered over each other. Each story then comments on the others, presenting many views. His plots are deceptively complex, but since they all share themes, they flow one into the next with an effortlessness that marks Moore as a truly sophisticated writer.<br/><br/>Many readers probably read right across the top of this story, flowing smoothly from one moment to the next, and never even recognizing the bustling philosophical exploration that moves the whole thing along. The story-within-a-story 'The Black Freighter' winds itself through the whole of Watchmen, and for Moore, serves several purposes. Firstly, it is another subversion of comic book tropes: Moore is tapping into the history of the genre, when books about pirates, cowboys, spacemen, monsters, and teen love filled the racks next to the superhuman heroes before that variety was obliterated by the Comics Code (yet another authoritarian act of destruction by people who thought they were morally superior). <br/><br/>But in the world of Watchmen, there are real superheroes, and they are difficult, flawed, politically motivated, and petty. So, superhero comics are unpopular in the Watchmen world, because there, superheroes are fraught with political and moral complexity. These are not the requisite parts of an escapist romp. We don't have comic books about our politicians, after all. We may have political satire, but that's hardly escapist fun.<br/><br/>So, instead they read about pirates. Beyond referencing the history of comics, 'The Black Freighter' works intertextually with Watchmen. The themes and events of one follow the other, and the transitions between them create a continuous exploration of ideas. Moore never breaks off his story, because even superficially unrelated scenes flow from one to the other, in a continuous, multilayered, self-referential narrative.<br/><br/>I continually stand in awe of Moore's ability to connect such disparate threads. Many comic authors since have tried to do the same, but from Morrison to Ellis to Ennis, they have shown that striking that right balance is one of the hardest things an author can do. Most of Moore's followers end up with an unpalatable mish-mash instead of a carefully prepared and seasoned dish.<br/><br/>Unlike most comic authors, Moore scripted the entire layout for the artist: every panel, background object, and action. Using this absolute control, Moore stretched the comic book medium for all it was worth, filling every panel with references, allusions, and details which pointed to the fullness and complexity of his world. Moore even creates meaning with structure, so that the size, shape, and configuration of panels tell much of the story for him. <br/><br/>One of the volumes is even mirrored, so that the first page is almost identical to the last, the second page to the second last, and so on. That most readers don't even notice this is even more remarkable. That means that Moore used an extremely stylized technique so well that it didn't interfere with the story at all.<br/><br/>But therein lies the difficulty: if a reader isn't looking for it, they will probably have no idea what makes this books so original and so remarkable. This especially true if they don't know the tropes Moore is subverting, or the allusive history he calls upon to contextualize his ideas.<br/><br/>While many readers enjoy the book purely on its artistic merit, the strength of the writing, and the well-paced plot, others disregard the work when they are unable to recognize what makes it revolutionary. One might as well try to read Paradise Lost with no knowledge of the Bible, or watch Looney Toons without a familiarity with 1940's pop culture.<br/><br/>It is not a perfect work, but there is no such thing. Moore's lead heroine is unremarkable, which Moore himself has lamented. He did not feel entirely comfortable writing women at that point in his career, and the character was forced on him by the higher ups. Luckily, she's not bad enough to ruin the work, and only stands out because she lacks the depth of his other characters.<br/><br/>His politics sometimes run to the anarchic, but often this is just a satire of violence and hubris. Moore gives no easy answers in his grand reimagining. His interlocking stories present many thoughts, and many points of view. In the end, it is up to the reader to decide for himself who was right or wrong--as if anyone truly could be.<br/><br/>Moore never insults the intelligence of his readers, and so creates a work with more depth than anyone is likely to plumb even after numerous readings. Likewise, he does not want you to 'hold on for the ride', but expects that you will engage and question and try to come to terms with his work, yourself. No one is necessarily the hero or villain, and many people find themselves cowed and unsure of such an ambiguous world, just as we do with the real world.<br/><br/>Watchmen is not instructional, nor is it simply a romp. This book, like all great books, is a journey that you and the author share. The work is meant to connect us to the real world, and not to let us escape from it. This is Moore's greatest subversion of the superhero genre, and does even more than Milton to \"justify the ways of God to man\", for many men delude themselves to godhood, yet even these gods cannot escape their fundamental humanity.<br/><br/><b>\n",

       "<span id=\"freeText3424706337462951837\" style=\"display:none\">I didn't read this until last year. I saw the film about six months later. I'm a new convert still radiant with that 'just converted' glow. <br/><br/>Along with the Sandman graphic novels this is my favourite work in the medium (Zenith and Preacher get honourable mentions). Watchmen wins over all of the other candidates in ambition. This is a work of vast ambition. It doesn't deliver on every level, it isn't perfect, but it contains so much that succeeds, and comes so close to fulfilling its promises that it would be churlish to mention any failings.<br/><br/>Alan Moore is a great writer. He's not a great writer for comics, he's a great writer period, who happens to have made the graphic novel his medium. Watchmen is at times literary, funny, erudite, tragic, exciting, intriguing... it's written for intelligent grown-up readers. <br/><br/>The plot sprawls, it's convoluted, it spans generations and a large cast. What keeps it together are the deeply personal stories on various scales. Its scope was what kept it from the big screen for so long, and in truth the movie (whilst good fun and well done, I thought) is just a 2D projection of this complex multi-dimensional work. That same complexity is stopping me from doing it justice in this short review. Rather than try I'm just going to back off the grandiose praise and return to the punchline:<br/><br/>This is a fun read. It's exciting. The artwork ROCKS. It's as deep as that hole Alice fell down, but you never notice you're falling. Pick it up. Read it with pride. If someone sneers at you for reading a comic-book... hit them with it.

These are hard questions to answer because there are no real answers. There is simply opinion and debate; it all depends on how you view the world. One thing remains certain though, the characters in here are so <u>devastatingly flawed. </u><br/><br/><img alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" height=\"202\" src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1445804342ra/16704388.gif\" width=\"500\"/><br/><br/><img alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1445804342ra/16704389.gif\" width=\"500\"/><br/><br/>On the other hand, you have Ozymandias who looks at the big picture. He sees the world for what it is, and tries to plan accordingly. Except, unlike Rorschach he attempts to tackle the bigger problems. To many, he is simply the villain. In reality he is as obscurely heroic as Rorschach and just as morally grey. Who has the right to sacrifice life? Who has the right to dictate people and make such a monumental decision? Well, nobody really. Yet, Ozymandias’ actions, essentially, save the world. Who can question his results? His methods are clearly debatable, though it was the only route open to him. There is simply no quantifiable right or wrong in this world; there is only neutrality and hypocrisy. <br/><br/><img alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1445804526ra/16704401.gif\" width=\"500\"/><br/><br/>This is where the self-actualised Comedian comes in. Unlike Rorschach, he is fully aware of his faults and corruptness. Unlike Ozymandias, he perceived that the world has no hope. So, what does he do? He embraces himself and indulges in his own overbearing personality. He knows what he is, and what he reflects, so he relishes in his own nature. He offers no guilt and feels no remorse: he simply doesn’t care about anything or anyone. In this he is more neutral than any other character; he isn’t in denial; he isn’t convinced he is right: he just knows that the world is, essentially, doomed. <br/><br/>So, why not enjoy it? It’s all a joke, after all. Right? <br/><br/><img alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1444841071ra/16561294.gif\" width=\"500\"/><br/><br/>There are so many conflicting and self-defeating morals in here. Never before have I read something in which so many people have been wrong, but at the same time so absolutely right. Then there is Jon, the so called God of America, the supreme Dr Manhattan. He is something else entirely. He could have changed everything. His power was practically limitless, but he barely lifted a finger until the last possible moment. And the pointing of that finger was an action that was both terrible and completely necessary. The answer became clear as to the question of his inaction: why should he bother with man? The Comedian got to him in this; he saw something in humanity that wasn’t worth saving. Rorschach saw it too, but he still tried to salvage the remnants of society through brutalising the brutalisers. Dr Manhattan, however, was simply too complex and too important to waste his time on the common man. He came through in the end though, surprisingly. Well, kind of. I thought he’d watch the world burn, but humanity did have another protector albeit one who committed necessary evils. <br/><br/>This was such a great piece of fiction; I don’t think I could ever do it justice in a review. Parts of this felt too intricate to put into words. This is a complete subversion of the entire genre and a full questioning of the flawed, and hypocritical, nature of humankind. It is a piece of work that will, simply put, never be forgotten by those that have experienced its mortifying splendour. This is the first comic book I’ve seriously considered to be great; it has become a gateway for me to explore the comic book universe that I’ve barely touched in the past. <br/><br/>So I ask you this: what comic book should I read next? Can any other comic really compare to this?<br/><br/><img alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1445804526ra/16704402.gif\" width=\"625\"/><br/></span>\n",

       "<span id=\"freeText1128203083275928311\" style=\"display:none\">I can understand why this is considered a holy tome in the field of graphic novels. The plot is complex, it’s unique, and it’s well drawn. Also, it’s got the Holy Grail of every geeky comic book fan's wetdreams – lots of cool gadgets and stuff.<br/><br/>I ain’t knocking that. Imagination abounds, and I am thoroughly impressed. I love that comic books and graphic novels create their entire world – but – BUT then again every piece of art creates it’s own world. And ALL OF THOSE OTHER ARTS MAKE EMOTIONALLY ENGAGING STORIES!<br/><br/>I get frustrated because my graphic-novel friends keep foisting these things on me. They love me, they see me as very imaginative and very supportive of their creativity, but they cannot seem to get why I go cold at graphic novels.<br/><br/>This one was thrust upon me, because I was affected by the movie The Dark Knight. I got emotionally engaged. I felt hopeless with Batman. I got a knot in my stomach when that horrible, unspeakable thing happened two-thirds of the way through the film. I was troubled by Joker’s logic, and I was frustrated with the people in the ferries. In other words, I WAS EMOTIONALLY ENGAGED!<br/><br/>A lot of these graphic novels and stuff seem to think that if they simply tickle your creative brain, they’ve succeeded. I want more – I want to laugh and cry and cheer and feel despair. I want a core of true human story. Gadgets and colors and costumes and superpowers don't make me weep or shout or ponder or giggle or sigh. Well, they make me sigh - with frustrationa nd boredom.<br/><br/>I know I sound angry at these things. I get frustrated, because I don’t think this is so hard to understand that I need emotional stimulation. And yet, my graphic-novel friends still press these books in my hand, hoping to unlock my wonder and amazement. <br/><br/>I was full of wonder and amazement at The Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay, a novel about a superhero and the super-human who spawned him. I am not above the magical, mystical, and fantastic (I love Harry Potter), but there has to be more than just gadgetry and explosions. There has to be honesty and the courage to plumb the human experience. I felt terribly at Kavalier’s struggles with violence and anti-Semitism in Eastern Europe. Sam Clay’s secrets were heart-breaking. Kavalier’s search for revenge and Sam’s search for respect were emotionally engaging. In Harry Potter, I rallied behind Mrs. Weasley's maternal drive. I loved Harry's indignance at cruelty. I thought Hermione's concern for elves was sweet, and complicated (who know they wanted to be slaves). Chabon succeeded at making me feel, and so did Rowling. Watchmen did not.<br/><br/>Watchmen is about two generations of heroes. One was human – using costumes, strength, and cunning. The next was led bys a superhuman, Dr. Manhattan – they were both human and somewhat superhuman. Then a law was passed making their work illegal, and they went underground. It’s only when someone starts bumping off the old retired heroes that a mystery starts, a mystery that asks the esoteric and totally intellectual (read: unemotional) question of why humans can be drawn to the edge of doom, and what they need to do to stop just at the edge.<br/><br/>Oh - for the people who know and love Watchmen - I felt bad for how Dr. Manhattan couldn’t have a human relationship. And I understood why Laurie got infuriated. The thrill of Laurie and Dan becoming superheroes again was honest and wonderful. But that was it – I didn’t feel the panic of the world ending (mostly because if it did happen, there’d be no story). I didn’t care for the casual use of rape as a plot point. None of the long-winded, theoretical discussion about whether humanity was worth saving had any emotional pull to me. I didn’t care. In all 413 pages, I had four honest emotional reactions. One of my reactions was anger at the tangential pirate story (don’t ask – it doesn’t have any emotional or thematic reason for being there – it was just added because someone thought it was cool). <br/><br/>Cool. There’s the problem. Cool things don’t make me feel. People can imagine and draw all the cool things in the world, and it won’t make me emotional engage. Cool things don’t make my heart race or break or pause. They leave me cold. Graphic novels are mostly cool.<br/></span>\n",

And the bottom line is that this book simply did not entertain me. It was too busy trying to be Deep and Meaningful and Teach Us A Lesson to actually do anything as lowbrow as make compelling characters the reader can identify with and have them do interesting and entertaining things.<br/><br/>While I love characters who are sucky human beings in small doses, stories where damn near everyone sucks like this one get on my nerves. I don't like reading stories filled with a bunch of irredeemable emo asshats who do shitty things to each other (and to humanity in general), and where the the themes of the story are pounded into your face with the delicacy of a sledgehammer. <br/><br/>So clearly not my cup of tea, but I'm obviously in the minority on this one.</span>\n",

       "<span id=\"freeText7161183652833517248\" style=\"display:none\">I've been in many discussions over the years -- some in classes I was teaching, some over pints in the bar, and still others late at night with people I love -- about what <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2041.Frances_Hodgson_Burnett\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Frances Hodgson Burnett\">Alan Moore</a> was trying to say with <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/472331.Watchmen\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Watchmen by Alan Moore\">Watchmen</a>, discussions about the meaning of his graphic novel, and I am convinced that the meaning is not what most people think.<br/><br/>Most people I have talked to look at Veidt's mini-Armageddon to bring peace as inherently evil -- and the most monstrous act in a book of monstrous acts. Veidt's act trumps The Comedian's attempted rape of Silk Spectre and the murder of his child in the womb; it trumps Rorschach's punishment of the child killer, his torture of \"innocent\" informants, and the brutality he delivers unto anyone he happens to see committing a \"crime,\" petty or otherwise; it trumps Dr. Manhattan's personal engagement in the Vietnam War; Veidt's action even seems to trump the not-so-petty criminal activities we see perpetrated by peripheral \"criminals\" throughout <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/472331.Watchmen\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Watchmen by Alan Moore\">Watchmen</a>.<br/><br/>On the surface, we tend to condemn Veidt's action because of its scale. It's cold and precise and sterile and necessarily takes the lives of \"millions of innocent people.\" We have been indoctrinated from the youngest ages to hate this kind of killing more than any other. Our great monsters are Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot, but we somehow find it in our hearts and minds to forgive Truman's nuclear attacks on Japan because they \"saved millions of lives,\" as a young Walter Kovacs (aka Rorschach) writes in an essay about his absent father, defending Nuclear War and the Truman doctrine, albeit at an early age. And if we can forgive Truman's attack (I recognize that some people cannot forgive that attack, but many, many can), why not forgive Veidt? If we can forgive one, we must forgive the other. Sure Veidt killed more people, but he saved more too, and created a utopia out of the chaos.<br/><br/>This discrepancy in our accepted opinions is not lost on Alan Moore; in fact, it is at the core of <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/472331.Watchmen\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Watchmen by Alan Moore\">Watchmen</a>. We see it being played out in dialogue and action by characters from The Comedian to Rorschach, from Ozymandias to Dr. Manhattan, and even in the supporting folk who populate Moore's distopian future.<br/><br/>When faced with this discrepancy and pressed to discover why Veidt's actions continue to rile us, it doesn't take long to uncover a deeper root for our disdain: our need for individuality and Veidt's destruction of the freedom to make our own mistakes. <br/><br/>This realization of our anger at Veidt and why his action is \"evil\" quickly becomes the accepted meaning of Moore's story: that derailing humanity's ability to choose is the greatest wrong anyone can commit (the secular see this as a fundamental attack on our freedom, while the religious see this as our fundamental gift from God, but they tend to add anger at Veidt for playing God), and that Veidt's utopia will fail because the power of the individual is too great -- it always overcomes.<br/><br/>I disagree. <br/><br/>I don't think Moore considers Veidt's act evil so much as misguided. I am not convinced that Moore believes in good and evil at all. Throughout <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/472331.Watchmen\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Watchmen by Alan Moore\">Watchmen</a> we are led to see one man as the man who \"gets it,\" and that figure is not Rorschach. Rorschach is a guide, nothing more. Rorschach acts as an Horatio figure, guiding us through the narrative, telling us what to pay attention to, whom to believe, what to see: mostly he is trying to get us to see The Comedian. If the story is anyone's it is The Comedian's. The Comedian is the man who <i>gets it</i>, and what the amoral Comedian gets is that morality is a construct designed to help us avoid despairing at what Moore believes is the truth: humanity is violent and base; it is ignoble; it is doomed to repeat and repeat and repeat its violence because that is what humanity does best -- violence -- and everything else is playacting. Thus, Veidt's mini-Armageddon is futile, not because of our noble individuality, not because of the strength of our human spirit, but because of the strength of our animal instincts. All those lives were wasted to create a utopia that simply couldn't be.<br/><br/>And Rorschach's journal, slipped through the door of the paper and ready to be printed, is the detonation cap.<br/><br/><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/472331.Watchmen\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Watchmen by Alan Moore\">Watchmen</a> may be the most hopeless popular book printed in the last fifty years, and the most truthful. I am continually shocked by its popularity (even if only as a cult phenomenon), but then maybe it is only popular through a quirk of misunderstanding. Then again, it could be popular because people understand it better than they're willing to admit.</span>\n",

This menagerie of misfits (Nite Owl, Dr. Manhattan, the Comedian, Ozymindas, Silk Spectre...) live and breathe, that is a FACT. Also, the match-cuts are cinematic in a work that is, ironically, dubbed \"unfilmable.\" A character in a comic book tells of his fate, which matches the action that occurs in the comic book WE are reading.

And I haven't been avoiding them. But when I'm looking around the house for something to read, I forget to wander over to the comics section. So finally he just made a stack of books for me, and I started with <i>Watchmen</i>. <br/><br/>And within the first few pages I was testing his patience with questions/comments including: <br/><br/>\"Why is Rorshach the hero when he's clearly insane?\" <br/>\"None of these people are very pleasant.\" <br/>\"Why doesn't Laurie shut up?\"<br/>\"Seriously. When does Laurie shut up?\" <br/>\"Are any of these people not crazy?\" <br/>\"The Comedian is a stupid super-hero name.\" <br/>\"I'm not good at looking at the pictures for information.\" <br/>\"I like the text parts between the chapters.\" <br/><br/>He told me that if I wasn't enjoying it I should just stop (and he was probably thinking, \"If she doesn't like whining, then why doesn't she shut up?\"). But I said it wasn't that I wasn't enjoying it--well, I wasn't enjoying it, but I was appreciating it. <br/><br/>And that's my final verdict, I guess. I didn't enjoy it, exactly, because I don't think you're supposed to *enjoy* a story in which at least three-fifths of the characters are certifiably insane or at least significantly imbalanced and in which New York City becomes a body-choked charnel house. <br/><br/>But I did *appreciate* the signficance of the book, I think. I think I understand, at least academically if not viscerally, the sea change this must have represented in the tone and depth of comic books/graphic novels, and what a huge influence and touchstone this book must be. <br/><br/>But in terms of pure individual reaction? Well, it was kind of like when I finally saw <i>The French Connection</i>. There's all this build up about <i>The French Connection</i> and what a great car chase it has and how influential it was and how it marked the birth of a new type of movie anti-hero who inhabited a realistic moral grey zone, blah, blah, blah. And then when you finally see it, you've seen so many subsequent films that were influenced by it that the original seems old hat. Having seen <i>Ronin</i>, I was not blown away by the car chase in <i>The French Connection</i>. So, my reaction to <i>Watchmen</i> was colored by the fact that I have only been exposed to comic books in a post-<i>Watchmen</i> world. I didn't read comics when I was young. Everything I know about comics I've learned from Aaron Matthew Polk, and he's a huge <i>Watchmen</i> fan, so I had already absorbed the <i>Watchmen</i> worldview without ever having read the book. <br/><br/>Of course, it's good to have read it so I have a better chance of participating in or at least following along with comic geek conversations. Now I, too, can speculate on casting should a <i>\n",

I have earned my one comic book badge. It's like being a puny-colored belt of some kind in karate. <br/><br/>The point is, I appreciated the book, sort of in the same way that I might appreciate a text I was assigned to read for a class. I mean, I get <i>Great Expectations</i>, but I'm not going to read it again. (Who is crazier: Miss Havisham or Rorshach? Discuss.)</span>\n",

Someone is killing the costumed adventurers and the very dark Rorschach, our guiding Virgil into this Inferno, is trying to get to the bottom of it. <i>Watchmen</i> deals in multiple time lines, from the early days of the 40’s 50’s and 60’s when the superheroes were welcomed and appreciated, to the 70’s when laws were passed to limit their legitimacy, to the current day, the 80’s here. Moore has constructed an alternate history, one in which Nixon remains president for a third term, one in which the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan continues on in to Pakistan and threatens nuclear war with the USA. These are not exactly the nicest superheroes. Rorschach is a psycho, a bloody vigilante, fierce, damaged, with a need for vengeance that often exceeds what is absolutely necessary. The Comedian is a nihilist who has committed an unspeakable crime against one of the other superheroes, as well as plenty of crimes against the non-hero community. Doctor Manhattan, the only character with super powers, and boy o boy what super powers, may not even care about the survivability of humanity any more. <br/><br/><img alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" height=\"xxx\" src=\"http://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1451632895i/17569720.jpg\" width=\"400\"/><br/><b>Billy Crudup</b> as Doctor Manhattan - from the film<br/><br/>So what is this all about? One central concern is action versus inaction. Faced with a world approaching the brink of nuclear annihilation, is it better to act or not act? If one is to act, how far can one go to save the earth? Acting in the service of larger causes has implications. Doc Manhattan and the Comedian are shown engaging in bloody carnage in an alternate Viet Nam War. Is murder in the service of country ok? If it is ok in war, how about in preventing war? And why couldn’t Doc Manhattan use his powers to transport the enemy into contained spaces instead of obliterating them? <br/><br/><img alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" height=\"xxx\" src=\"http://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1451633052i/17569770.jpg\" width=\"400\"/> (<br/><b>The Comedian</b><br/><br/>Is Moore a fan of the right-wing or a critic? My take is the latter. On the surface we hear Rorschach droning on about the moral depravity of the city a la Travis Bickel, while practicing his own form of depravity on any who get in his way. The right-wing, rabble-rousing newspaper in the book certainly has plenty of parallels in our world. I do not think he was flattering in his view of them. Moore was writing in response, I believe, to Thatcherism, when creatures like Maggie and Reagan were seen as heroes by their fans, to the detriment of most of us. I read that Moore set <i>Watchmen</i> in an alternate reality so as not to turn off Reaganistas. Who is watching the leaders? And who is watching the watchers? <br/><br/><img alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" height=\"xxx\" src=\"http://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1451633691i/17569878.jpg\" width=\"400\"/><br/><b>Nite Owl - from the book and as portrayed by Patrick Wilson in the film</b><br/><br/>If these are the heroes we get, who needs heroes? Unlike the dominantly rose-tinted superheroes of the past, the <i>Watchmen</i> heroes are far past flawed. What actually do these characters value? Doc Manhattan struggles even with the notion of valuing the continuation of the human race. The Comedian thinks that life is a big, bloody joke, G. Gordon Liddy with a special outfit, and Rorschach sees filth everywhere. Unlike most superhero tales, this one lacks a super-villain. So the heroes have to deal with less simplistic challenges. It takes more to be a superhero than merely the ability to beat up the baddie. They have to use their brains, figure things out, struggle with very difficult moral choices. <br/><br/>One annoyance here was that I felt the females in the story tend to serve as plot devices for the development of the male characters rather than as fully realized characters in their own right.<br/><br/><img alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" height=\"x\" src=\"http://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1451634054i/17569934.jpg\" width=\"400\"/><br/><b>Silk Spectre - pen and ink, and Carly Gugino in the film</b><br/><br/><i>Watchmen</i> is part Batman, part noir detective story, part cold war crisis of nerves. It represented a sea change in the presentation of graphic heroes, from a more innocent time in which good was good and bad was bad, for the most part, to one in which the distinctions are much less clear. <i>Watchmen</i> resonates on many levels and remains, on re-reading, a powerful tale. <br/></span>\n",

Someone is killing off costumed superheroes, and the world is on the brink of nuclear war. I wasn't expecting to like this book. What, I wondered, did a comic from the late eighties have to offer me, a hip and happening girl in the oughts? You can practically see the dots in the color! I'd checked it out from the library on the advice of friends, and I'd tried to read it once before, but gave up before I got even five pages in. I still had it, though, so I gave it another chance because it's supposed to have revolutionized the superhero genre and the cover promised me it was both brilliant and peerless. Well, it pretty much is.<br/><br/>The art's not memorable, but it does the job. It caries along a compelling, multi-layered story and never gets in the way. It actually has a lot of information in it, and I loved all the details, the ads for Nostalgia perfume and Meltdown candies, the ever changing face of Rorschach, the Gunga Diner elephant, the spraypainted and sometimes incomplete \"Who watches the watchmen?\" graffiti, the newspaper headlines, and the intercuts between the pirate comic and the superhero story. Things did get a little preachy while we were on Mars and Antarctica, but I forgive Moore because he delivers such engrossing prose pieces at the end of each chapter. The excerpts from magazines, scholarly journals, Hollis Mason's autobiography, and Veidt's personal papers were actually fun to read. I normally don't like large blocks of unillustrated text in graphic novels, but these complemented the story perfectly, giving us background we wouldn't have gotten otherwise. <br/><br/>Five stars. Watchmen is a rich, clever, fully realized universe, and if you haven't read it, you really should. I hear it's peerless.</span>\n",

It's not something I'd usually like- ultra-violent with a very dark vision of humanity- but there is something incredibly compelling about it.<br/><br/>It starts with a murder. <i>Watchmen</i> is the story of a group of super heroes who don't fight crime anymore because vigilantism was outlawed. Among the many costumed regular heroes (The Comedian, Rorschach, Nite Owl), there is an actual superhero, Dr. Manhattan, who suffered a freak radiation accident and was changed, permanently. He perceives time as happening all at once and can manipulate matter in multiple dimensions. Each of the heroes has a story, some are very sad, and all of them are upset as one of their own has just been killed. Can they figure out who the murderer is before he/she strikes again?<br/><br/>My favorite character out of the bunch is Dr. Manhattan. <i>\"We gaze continually at the world and it grows dull in our perceptions. Yet seen from another's vantage point, as if new, it may still take the breath away.\"</i> pg 27, Chapter XI. He's nearly godlike in his capabilities but that makes it practically impossible for anyone to understand him.<br/><br/>My husband's favorite is Rorschach, which I could understand, but he was far too violent for me to truly appreciate the character. I feel like there's an underlying importance to that character though, something that I couldn't quite grasp...I tried thinking about Rorschach as a rorschach blot for the <i>Watchmen</i> and it nearly broke my brain. <a class=\"jsShowSpoiler spoilerAction\">(view spoiler)</a><span class=\"spoilerContainer\" style=\"display: none\">[It's as if how you perceive this character says more about you than the story itself. Normal man, horrific upbringing, violent tendancies, won't quit killing evil people even when being a super hero is outlawed, won't give up even when the main villain of the story has made it clear that he's won. I cheer for the man, but I wouldn't want to be anywhere near him. <a class=\"jsHideSpoiler spoilerAction\">(hide spoiler)</a>]</span><br/><br/>And the comic within the comic? Fascinating. <a class=\"jsShowSpoiler spoilerAction\">(view spoiler)</a><span class=\"spoilerContainer\" style=\"display: none\">[A marooned sailer tries desperately to return to his family to save them from a pirate ship, but along the way, he becomes the monster that he feared. Exactly like the Watchmen. <a class=\"jsHideSpoiler spoilerAction\">(hide spoiler)</a>]</span><br/><br/>The <i>Watchmen</i> is more than a superhero story: it's an examination of power both physical and in the heart. It's a criticism of government, the media, and art used to manipulate others. It looks at gender roles, rape, and sexual preferences and predilections. It asks: why would a person dress up and create an alter ego in the first place? And, beyond all that, it is a mystery and a love story. There's a lot to enjoy in here if you can get past the blood, gore, and soul crushing darkness. Recommended for an adult audience only.<br/><br/>A similar comic, in my mind, is <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6465707.The_Walking_Dead__Compendium_1\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"The Walking Dead, Compendium 1 by Robert Kirkman\">The Walking Dead, Compendium 1</a> by <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/12425.Robert_Kirkman\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Robert Kirkman\">Robert Kirkman</a>.

       "<span id=\"freeText4000675448413214196\" style=\"display:none\">It’s been fairly said a hundred times in the 27 years since its publication that writer and artist Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons respectively have created something immortal which then influenced other works and changed the comics medium forever. <i>Watchmen</i> also won the Hugo award in 1988 and was the only graphic novel to make it to Time magazine’s 100 Greatest Books 2005 list. So why the enduring legacy?<br/><br/>Like any other kid, I’ve loved superheroes for as long as I could remember. I consider Batman a childhood hero as much as the great detective Sherlock Holmes was. I never realized or truly appreciated the extent of my hero worship until I first encountered <i>Batman: The Animated Series</i> when I was thirteen. Before that, I was eight years old when I first watched X-Men as a Sunday cartoon but it was nothing compared to the poetry that is BTAS. I became drawn to the darker side of superheroes since then but I still didn’t know what the darker side really means until 2005 when the second installment of Christopher Nolan’s Batman franchise <i>The Dark Knight</i> hit the theaters. I didn’t know that it was an allegory of the Bush administration’s War on Terror but I did understand that Batman’s vigilantism is not always as heroic and anyone who would put on a mask and fight crime has some serious issues to deal with. This was why the superhero action flicks that came after TDK never appealed to me anymore and it was only when in 2010 I watched the Director’s Cut of Zack Snyder’s <i>Watchmen</i> and I finally realized what it was about the superhero that I wanted to unmask. I got my copy of the original graphic novel two months after and I’ve been engrossed with reading it so much that I decided to record my thoughts in a podcast and liked what I was doing so I went on for the next chapters, given that I also received support from some people in the Watchmen fandom I became a part of. <br/><br/>I do feel that it is an important work not because it was the first attempt to deconstruct the superhero genre although that partly drives the legacy of <i>Watchmen</i>, but rather it has something more to do with Watchmen’s depth, complexity and artistic understanding of a medium like comic books which has been on the unflattering receiving end of the majority. <i>Watchmen</i> made readers and writers of the medium to aspire for something greater. It never belittled its audience and it embraced the conventions of the medium as well as it satirized it. It was a social commentary masquerading as entertainment. It was a psychological examination of characters who are supposed to represent and parody the superhero archetypes. It’s a celebration of the American spirit and creative achievement. It’s a story with a material that lets you discuss it with other people and encourages even scholarly discourses. <i>Watchmen</i> as a definitive work challenged moral philosophies through the symbol, meaning and message of the superhero. <br/><br/><i>Watchmen</i> deconstructed and parodied both superhero and villain archetypes. Superman is examined through Dr. Manhattan, Batman’s duality is explored in Nite Owl and Rorschach, The Comedian is the less than desirable version of Captain America with a twisted sense of humor and chaos similar to that of the Joker. Silk Spectre II demonstrated that there is more to the femme fatale persona of female masked adventurers. And Ozymandias personally reminded me of Superman’s arch-nemesis Lex Luthor. What Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons intended was to reinvent characters from the Charlton comics series but instead came up with these characters that we know and love based on the genre’s archetypes.<br/><br/><i>Watchmen</i> has twelve chapters which represented the metaphorical format of twelve minutes to midnight from the Doomsday clock during the Cold War. It also breathlessly transported us in an alternate American history where superheroes co-existed with us and have therefore influenced the course of events, lifestyles and technological discoveries. Vigilantes and masked avengers became celebrities during the mid-forties and outlaws during the seventies. We are taken into the heart of things through the paranoid but often also reasonable ramblings of Rorschach who investigates the murder of a retired government-sponsored hero named Edward Blake and instead uncovers an intricate web of conspiracies perpetuated by a self-made billionaire and self-proclaimed smartest man in the world, Adrian Veidt. <br/><br/>There are sideline adventures and dramatic storylines where a demigod named Dr. Manhattan leaves the planet he no longer wishes to be entangled with, where a woman named Laurie Juspeczyk once and for all throws away the shoes her mother has forced her to fill for years, where Daniel Dreiberg a miserable man who overcomes his impotency by embracing the life he had always wanted regardless of rules and where a modest newspaper vendor does something heroic for a high school kid he barely knew but whom he shares a common name with. These are the stories that touched us deeply, felt through unforgettable characters who took us on a journey that became very personal and often transcendental.<br/><br/>I think <i>Watchmen</i> for me is a celebration of the superhero genre indeed and that in reading this graphic novel, it made me appreciate superheroes for everything they’re supposed to stand for and reflect and what their value and myth mean in the societies we live in; how they sometimes parody our lives, whether it’s the simple act of putting on a mask and a costume to fight crime or by exposing and dismantling parts of our psyche and civilization through showcasing the consequences of vigilantism, of living a double life and of placing the fate of an entire race on certain people who are burdened with their personal motivations. But ordinary people with their flaws and compensations and problems—they’re the ones that we must connect with, not these ideals we created and placed on superheroes. <br/><br/><b>RECOMMENDED: 10/10</b><br/><i>* For three years now I’ve been so deeply engrossed in this work and I’m not afraid to say that it made my life better, giving me new perspective about the world in a way only a beautiful literature can do. </i></span>\n",

How to review the unreviewable? <br/><br/>Iconic. Classic. Nostalgic. Reinvented comics and the anti-hero. Redefined meta-fiction. If Alan Moore is known for only one thing, it's Watchmen. <br/><br/>It's pre-apocalyptic alternate 1985 America. The Cold War. Gay rights. Women's rights. And costumed heroes are outlawed. Suddenly these retired heroes are being killed off, and it's left to the anti-hero Rorschach and depressive Nite Owl to discover the mysterious truth!<br/><br/>What's funny is that Watchmen is a one trick pony, but a really fucking incredible pony. It's drama, pure and simple, gritty and dark and stylistic. With underlying allegory, sociopolitical commentary, suspense, mystery, and hardcore violence. Seriously, if there's one thing Watchmen isn't it's funny. But that's okay. <br/><br/>I really do like Alan Moore's writing here. This is my second read since 2009, and even seven years didn't dull my enjoyment. It's a slow burn, but it's like sci-fi soup, rich and complex and weird, with plenty of things to mentally chew. Especially as most of the story takes place in New York. The city, the world, and its inhabitants are unique and dynamic. We see far beyond just Nite Owl and Rorschach, Dr. Manhattan and Silk Spectre. We see the newspaper vendor and comic book kid, both named Bernie. We see the psychiatrist and his wife. We see the cabbie and her girlfriend. Moore populates his hero world with incredible characters. <br/><br/>Dave Gibbons is awesome. I'm biased because I'm so young. I have no idea what comics were in the 1980s. I've heard that Gibbons' style isn't especially striking for the time, but his colors and cinematic vision are, however. I've said it before, colors make or break a comic book. And these really are incredible. What strikes me about these colors is their arbitrariness. They're just weird. But they're eerie and beautiful, and lend to the story's alternative world. <br/><br/>So there you have it. Watchmen is badass. Alan Moore isn't a god but you can't deny his impression. And Dave Gibbons absolutely made this book and made these characters and this world come alive. <br/><br/><i>A short note on the Deluxe Edition...</i> This sucks. I bought it several years ago before I knew what to look for in editions and this is my first time reading it. The black and yellow dust jacket looks fine, but it wraps a cheap cover that damages easily. The paper is terrible. Thin, low gloss pulp that's almost newsprint. The heavily glued binding is crazy tight and refuses to lay flat, with moderate gutter loss. And there's so much glue that two pages stuck together and tore! How's that for deluxe? The extras were okay, mostly light pencil sketches, not really worth paying more than the paperback. If you love Watchmen and want a proper edition, I would suggest the Absolute, which I will be getting to replace this.</span>\n",

       "<span id=\"freeText4219400772160600608\" style=\"display:none\">Imagine the poster of a superhero. Bold lines curving around supple limbs, a palate of strong colors suffusing every empty space with black, yellow, red arcing in a heroic spray of vitality. It inspires an intense nostalgia for the days of black and white, where good was good and evil was evil, the latter never lasting for very long. You remember your childhood, filled with dreams and hobbies and racing through the world with bright eyes and an eager mind. <br/><br/>The poster is in an alleyway. It is filthy, and dark, and cold, and there is a sour smell of urine mixed with mustard and pot blowing across your face. You can see the poster hung by a door by way of the guttering light of a neon sign, 'LIQUOR' buzzing faintly into the night. The superhero's bold and strong design is marred with the bulges of its brick framework, poster plastered in wedges that have managed to survive the brutal onslaught of the elements for many years. Holes poke through where the survival was incomplete, including an unfortunate rip that reduces the right eye to a gaping maw, edges fluttering faintly as the acrid wind continues to blow. <br/><br/>You turn. There is something in the alleyway you can't quite see, a limp bundle nearly invisible to the eye, save for the glitter of something that manages to catch a little light from the decrepit sign. You step closer. The glitter is from a cheap metal bracelet, hanging from the slim ankle of a leg that even in the flaky light shows evidence of abuse, worsening as skin approaches skirt. You crouch, get a good look at her face. She can't be more than fourteen. Then you see the hole in her forehead, partially obscured by her bangs that frame a face still in the flush of youth, save for a gout of blood that is sluggishly pooling on her shoulder. <br/><br/>You stand, hastening to leave the alleyway with its silent sentinels. It's a tragic shame, what happened to her. But you can't afford to be caught with her. Would cause too much trouble. Besides, you're no superhero or crime fighter, someone capable of punishing the culpable. You have a normal job, a normal family, a normal life. There's no time to care about the misfortunes of complete strangers. Let the stronger ones, the smarter ones, the richer ones worry about all of humanity. Your mind whispers, what if they are the ones responsible? Who will keep them in line? But you squash it. You have enough problems of your own.<br/><br/>Making your way home takes you by a church in the midst of a mass, choir voices ringing out in a hallelujah that compels you to pause and listen for a small while. The lights, shining through slender archways, rising with the climbing voices to noble towers that frame the night sky so much more elegantly than their crude apartment complex neighbors. A single choir member reaches a single note so pure, you momentarily forget whatever concerns you were dwelling on, and marvel on 'the music of the spheres', a phrase you haven't heard since your days at high school. <br/><br/>Such beauty, not more than five blocks away from the scene of such an ugly crime. Such small, violent, petty concerns, framed alongside an ancient society concerned with adulation of grand cosmic forces. A brutal squirming of the physical, and the stately worship of surmounting it. Survival, squaring off with the reason to survive.<br/><br/>And humanity is responsible for both.<br/><br/>You hurry home. It's cold, and your thoughts are troubling. Better to drink and sleep it off. Tomorrow's another day.</span>\n",

       "<span id=\"freeText10562184400539475863\" style=\"display:none\">Two realizations occurred to me while reading this book:<br/><br/>1. The movie version, while long as hell, is actually really well done and accurate. And by \"accurate\" I of course mean \"basically a frame-by-frame reproduction of the graphic novel.\" Not necessarily a bad thing, although they do change some details of the ending a little. I was okay with both versions, though. I think I still prefer the graphic novel, mostly because when I read it I don't have to deal with the horribly miscast Malin Ackerman. I knew she was ruining Silk Spectre II before I even read the original story. Every other character is perfectly cast, though, so it's mostly okay.<br/><br/>2. The movie <i>The Incredibles</i> is <i>Watchmen</i> for kids. For example, in excerpts from his book that are spaced throughout the graphic novel, a former superhero discusses his costume-making process: \"I experimented with a cloak, remembering how the Shadow would use his cloak to misguide enemy bullets...In practice, however, I found it too unwieldy. I was always tripping over it or getting it caught in things, and so I abandoned it for an outfit that was as streamlined as I could make it.\" <br/>Or, as Edna Mode would say, \"NO CAPES!\" <br/><br/>Movie references aside, I really liked all the technical details about being a superhero I'd never considered before (for example, how do they keep those little masks stuck to their faces? Spirit gum.), as well as the psychology of the superhero. That's really the whole point of <i>Watchmen</i>: the kind of people who are willing to put on a costume and fight crime may not be the kind of people you actually <i>want</i> to have running around beating up criminals. Case in point: Rorschach. I...I don't even have words to describe this character. The movie didn't even really do him justice. <br/><br/>In conclusion, amazing and thought-provoking and everyone should read it, even if you've never picked up a graphic novel before. <br/><br/>\"Yes, we were crazy, we were kinky, we were Nazis, all those things that people say. We were also doing something because we believed in it. We were attempting, through our personal efforts, to make our country a safer and better place to live in. Individually, working on our separate patches of turf, we did too much good in our respective communities to be written off as mere aberration, whether social or sexual or psychological. <br/>It was only when we got together that our problems really started....Dressing up in costume takes a very extreme personality, and the chances of eight such personalities getting along together were about seventy-eleven million to one against.\" </span>\n",

None of them seemed very heroic when it came down to it, and the only one of them with actual superpowers didn't care about anything at all. I still don't know if I like it, and it certainly wasn't enjoyable to read. Most of the time it made me feel slightly nausious, but I think that was what the writer and artist were going for. I am, however, glad that I read it. It was different and I can see why this thing has been talked about so much for all of these years.

That is until I saw \"Watchmen\" - the movie that amazed me by its complexity and cleverness. Needless to say, I just had to see what kind of material it was based on. I wasn't disappointed. <br/><br/>Let me start by saying that I though the movie did this book justice, especially visually. But reading this graphic novel just added an entire new layer to the story, making it even deeper and more complex than I thought it was. The characters of Dr. Manhattan, Ozymandias, Rorschach, and even Comedian were original and unforgettable. Bravo! - is all I can say. Highly recommend. <br/></span>\n",

       "<span id=\"freeText8079422780882390344\" style=\"display:none\"><b>Watchmen: Changed the genre forever (Graphic Novel &amp; Movie Review)</b><br/>Originally posted at <a href=\"http://www.fantasyliterature.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fantasy Literature</a><br/>What more can be said about this brilliant, game-changing graphic novel from 1987? It challenged, deconstructed, and redefined the superhero story to the point that it’s hard to imagine any comic book writer not being fully cognizant of Alan Moore and Dave Gibbon’s Watchmen when they put pen to paper (or finger to keyboard). Despite it coming out almost 30 years ago, it’s remained continuously in print with its iconic yellow smiley face with a drop of blood. Most fans consider it the greatest graphic novel ever written, and Time Magazine named it one of the 100 best English-language novels. I’m not an expert in comics or graphic novels, but I wouldn’t disagree. In fact, until recently it was the only graphic novel (other than Frank Miller’s SIN CITY series) I’d read in the past 25 years despite a life-long love of SFF.<br/><br/>I think Watchmen addresses a lot of the reasons WHY I wasn’t interested in comics all that time. They’re right next to SFF books in the bookstore, and they feature stories that are mostly fantastic in nature. Not only that, but they having amazing cover artwork that really catches the eye. So what’s the problem? I guess my memories of comics are from the mid-1980s, and back then when I read G.I. JOE and TRANSFORMERS, I’m pretty sure I was just brain-washed by Hasbro. The stories weren’t great and neither was the artwork. I was never really interested in SUPERMAN, BATMAN, THE AVENGERS, X-MEN, etc. The stories seemed too simplistic (just a preconception – I didn’t actually read them) and filled with KAPOWS and THWACKTS ala Adam West’s classic Batman TV series. Once I was actively reading 500-page SFF novels as a teenager, I simply assumed that comics COULD NOT achieve the same depth of story and character that books can. <br/><br/>However, over the last two decades Hollywood has discovered what an absolute treasure trove comic book superheroes are. They’re ready-made franchises with thousands of episodes and story-arcs, iconic characters that everyone knows, and tons of product tie-in potential. It’s been a bonanza for MARVEL and DC, the two industry heavy-hitters. And most people now know who Frank Miller and Stan Lee are. One of the biggest trends of more recent years has been the increasingly dark and complicated nature of super heroes. You need look no further that the original Tim Burton versions of Batman from the 1990s to the incredibly dark vision of Christopher Nolan’s DARK KNIGHT series.<br/><br/>It’s very likely that Watchmen (and Frank Miller’s DARK KNIGHT reinterpretation) deserve a lot of credit for that trend toward dark, complicated, and twisted superheroes, to the point where the term “hero” comes into question. In Watchmen there may be a lot of characters dressed in costume, but you’d be hard-pressed to identify the “superheroes” among them. In fact, it’s fair to question whether they are “super” at all. The characters of Watchmen are all attracted to the idea of the “superhero”, that person with extraordinary abilities who uses them to fight crime and injustice. And while there is certainly one character (Doc Manhattan) who has incredible powers far beyond most superheroes, he is distant and uninvolved in human affairs despite his human origins and love interests. <br/><br/>Watchmen asks the disarmingly simple question, “What is a superhero, and why would anyone want to be one?” I mean, they’re dressing up in tights and spandex and going around beating up criminals. That’s not a “normal” career. In fact, how do superheroes earn income? Do they pay taxes? Do they take those costumes to a dry-cleaners or hand-wash only? The more you think about it, the more ridiculous it sounds. We all know that crime pays, but what about crime-fighting? You don’t get much besides the keys to the city, a handshake from the mayor, and the thankful smiles of a grateful citizenry. So wanting to be a superhero is something internally-driven. Even then, why? The thrill of anonymity, perhaps, or the desire to become someone more exciting than the everyday prosaic middle-aged tax accountant with the nice house, pretty wife, 2 cars, golf membership, kids and a dog. Then again, maybe you really have a grudge against crime and want to champion the weak. You might have been the victim of a terrible crime and vowed to dedicate your life to protecting people from such a fate. Or maybe it just seemed like a cool idea and you didn’t have any other particular plans.<br/><br/>There are so many themes explored in Watchmen that you could easily teach a college lit course about it, and there are in fact such classes, though I was never fortunate enough to take one. Our very own FanLit comic expert Brad tells me he has taught this text many times to many of his students. It’s guaranteed to produce a lot of amazing discussions, I’m sure. It’s also clearly intended to be read multiple times, and I’ve read it twice. So to avoid driving myself insane trying to cover every aspect of this multi-layered work of art, I’m going to stick to the central theme of “what is a superhero, and why be one?” One of the great aspects about Watchmen is that it is a deeply moral work that concerns itself with justice, free-will, evil, despotism, hubris, and yet it never spells out its agenda, or cheapens its characters by making them mouth-pieces for the author’s pet ideas. Of course each character explores aspects of the superhero concept, but none of them fit that Golden Age stereotype with bulging muscles, a square jaw and deep voice, and an untiring drive to fight crime.<br/><br/>Below is a basic synopsis of the main characters of Watchmen. There is an earlier set of superheroes that arose in the 1940s and 1950s in this alternate reality, but I won’t even attempt to describe them. They form the basic conceptual framework for superheroes, but I’m most interested in the characters who drive the main story arc in the 1980s:<br/>THE COMEDIAN (Eddie Blake): This guy is a big, cynical and amoral thug. He revels in conflict and violence – although ostensibly falling under the “superhero” rubric, he quickly finds he has no problems taking down Latin American dictators as a government operative. He also takes great pleasure in killing “badguys”, which in Vietnam basically meant everyone opposed to US forces. Machine guns, flame throwers, fists &amp; kicks, it’s all good to the Comedian. Because to him life is one big, ironic joke. The joke being that you’re a sucker if you believe there is any justice or purpose in our lives. The strong take what they want, and the weak don’t. Who would you rather be? His philosophical differences with Nite Owl are fascinating, and his emotional dealings with both iterations of Silk Spectre show his best and worst sides. <br/><br/>RORSHACH (Walter Kovacs): Rorshach sees the world in black and white, a simple dualism of good and evil. He was bullied as a child, railed against his prostitute mother, and developed an intense and smoldering hatred for the worst aspects of humanity. This hatred is so all-consuming that it leaves little room for sympathy for the common man. As a form of self-validation, Rorshach spends all his time hunting down criminals of the streets, beating and killing them without mercy. Those that hurt children in particular draw his ire. Where he struggles is finding room for anything that doesn’t fit his ultra-narrow worldview. There are no grays in his moral universe, only black and white shifting but never mixing, like his mask. He is an angel of vengeance, a vigilante with the noblest intentions. But is he a hero, or a vigilante? Does purity of intent and purpose justify his ruthless killing? Readers who sympathize with Rorshach should examine their politics in other areas as well. Maybe he is right, maybe humanity is unworthy, but what an awful way to live each day. <br/><br/>NITE OWL (Daniel Dreiberg): The modern-day Nite Owl is actually the second to wear the costume. Dan Dreiberg inherited a lot of money from his banker father, and has a deep love for flying machines and animals. One suspects he wishes he could just watch owls all day and fly with them. He was the crime-fighting sidekick of Rorshach and the Comedian, but has hung up the wings to do…nothing. His life seems fairly pointless after quitting crime-fighting. He tinkers in his place alone, only reliving the old times with weekly beer sessions with the senior Nite Owl. His characters is pretty wimpy until he catches Silk Spectre on the rebound from Doc Manhattan, at which points things spice up a bit. Although he is perhaps the most normal of the Watchmen, he is hardly heroic. <br/><br/>OZYMANDIAS (Adrian Veidt): After retiring from crime-fighting, Adrian has become an extremely-successful businessman who is also “the smartest man in the world”. He is incredibly athletic and handsome, skilled at hand-to-hand combat, and markets his own training program. In other words, he’s that guy from high school everyone hates and envies. He runs Veidt Enterprises, and is something of an unholy combination of Tony Starks (rich, charismatic, brilliant) and Donald Trump (complete egomaniac, superiority complex). Adrian’s biggest problem is that he is so superior to the average man that he can’t help looking down on him. This causes him to hatch an elaborate and evil master-plan that any super villain would be proud of.<br/><br/>SILK SPECTRE (Laurie Juspeczyk): Laurie is the weakest character in the group, and probably Moore’s least impressive creation. It seems clear that he had trouble coming up with a viable female superhero. One wonders what would happen if he had instead tried a Harley Quinn-type villain with some charm. Laurie’s mom was Sally Jupiter, the original Silk Spectre, who had some ties to the Comedian in the past. Laurie grew up idolizing her superhero mom, and so has followed in her footsteps. However, her main purpose seems to be the love interest for Doc Manhattan, his last emotional connection to humanity. <br/><br/>DOC MANHATTAN (Jon Osterman): He is by far the most interesting of Moore’s creations. Doc was a promising scientist studying particle physics. When an experiment goes terribly wrong, he is initially atomized before finding a way to reconstruct himself, atom by atom, and become this all-powerful blue man-figure with a great physique and disdain for clothing. He still stays with his girlfriend at the time, but the US military increasingly uses him for geopolitical power politics, particularly to maintain a precarious edge over the USSR in an alternate version of the Cold War (perhaps the only plot element that feels overly 1980s). The stresses of being used for his powers (including the Vietnam War) despite his growing disillusionment with the petty conflicts of humanity eventually spoils his relationship, but instead he shacks up with the Laurie, the younger iteration of Silk Spectre. She too suffers from his clumsy inability to understand the emotional needs of another human being, let alone a lover. <br/><br/>We see Doc Manhattan wield almost unlimited powers over matter, creating and destroying at will. And yet when he gets completely fed up with the tawdry squabbles of mankind, he ditches Earth and heads to Mars for some R&amp;R, meditating and creating a fantastic geodesic artifact to occupy himself. What we see in him is a far more realistic portrayal of what an all-powerful being is likely to behave like. Unlike Jehovah of the Old Testament, who is constantly punishing humanity for every little transgression like a petulant child smashing his toys, Doc Manhattan can’t be bothered with people. Seriously, why would you when the world of tachyons and quarks are so much more interesting. <br/><br/>The other fascinating thing about Doc is that he lives in a quantum universe, so he experiences time as a continuum, seeing past, present, and future simultaneously. Moore really nails the mechanics of avoiding time paradoxes: my favorite pet peeve involves that hairy old chestnut “going back to change things”. It’s very simple, really: you can’t change anything because time already exists and is fixed. You can look up and down the line, but don’t think you can change it. This means that Doc knows the future but can’t do anything about it. That makes it pretty frustrating when Laurie tries to have conversations with him. It also makes the universe a very deterministic place and discounts the concept of free will. Even if we are free to make our choices, they have already been made in the quantum universe.<br/><br/>So the clever reader must have noticed, where are all the super villains, the Jokers, Penguins, Magnetos, Green Goblins, Lex Luthors, etc? Haven’t figured it out yet? There are no super villains in the real world, silly, that’s just in comic books. And Watchmen is not some pulpy wish-fulfillment fantasy. It’s about the world you and I live in, filled with well-intentioned but imperfect people with passions, aspirations, dreams, psychoses, problems, frustrations and occasional triumphs like everyone else. It’s just that some of them wear costumes, that’s all.<br/><br/>Dave Gibbon’s Artwork/Tales of the Black Freighter:<br/><br/>The comic medium is distinct from novels because of the artwork, and the artwork of Watchmen is truly special. It is an example of total artistic commitment by both author and artist to achieve something never before seen in the genre. Dave Gibbons was given extremely detailed instructions by Moore for each frame, and they agree to use a 9-panel layout to give a uniform structure, unlike the more common variable size/number of panels. Gibbons inserted an incredible number of details into each panel, especially the various textual media found throughout the book, such as newspapers, graffiti, TV screens, book covers, etc. Much of these visual clues point to the impending countdown of the doomsday clock ticking down to nuclear Armageddon. There is also the pervasive metaphor of the smiley face button, which the Comedian uses for ironic purposes, but I see the iconic image of the drop of blood covering the face as a clever metaphor for how the innocent ideal of comic book heroism is tainted by the violence and death of the real world. There is such a wealth of visual details in the book, not to mention the book-within-a-book horrific pirate story called Tales of the Black Freighter, that I have never seen in graphic novels before. And the crowning touches are the inserts between chapters of excerpts from the autobiography of Hollis Mason (the original Nite Owl) that describe the origins of the first generation of superheroes (the Minutemen) in the 1940-50s, articles describing the history of Doc Manhattan and his impact on the Cold War, a description of the artists involved in early pirate comics, police documents of Rorshach, snippets from the New Frontiersman newspaper, even super-realistic notes from a Hollywood producer corresponding with Sally Jupiter, the original Silk Spectre. The verisimilitude and depth achieved with these interludes gives Watchmen the feel of a completely three-dimensional experience, encompassing storyline, character history, story-within-story, and visual elements. <br/><br/>Watchmen Film (2009, directed by Zack Snyder)<br/><br/>It was inevitable that a graphic novel as epic and complex as Watchmen would attract the attention of filmmakers. However, as is frequently a case with such a dense and complicated storyline, finding the right people to come up with the right screenwriters, producers, directors, and studio is an extremely difficult task. So the film got bounced around Hollywood for years and years, with directors and producers as diverse as Joel Silver, Terry Gilliam, Darren Aronofsky, and Paul Greenglass before the stars aligned and Zack Snyder was given the nod thanks to his distinctive visual work on Frank Miller’s 300.<br/><br/>The film version has a big budget of $120 million but hardly any major household names. The costs mostly involve the elaborate sets and special effects. The Watchmen graphic novel served as the storyboard. Visually, fans of the original will immediately recognize scene after scene from the comic, and Snyder did an excellent job bringing the dark and dystopian tone of the book to the screen. He also brings strength in the kinetic and violent action sequences, especially with sudden switches to slow motion in mid fight. The faithful careful attention to details extents to the beautiful geodesic glass artifact constructed by Doc Manhattan on Mars. It looks exactly as I envisioned it from Dave Gibbon’s artwork.<br/><br/>The acting isn’t quite as strong as the visual work, but I was satisfied with the fiercely uncompromising Rorshach and cynical Comedian. Nite Owl was played accurately as a fairly milquetoast aging superhero who has almost forgotten his glorious crime-fighting past, but I enjoyed his character when he finally takes out the Owlship with Silk Spectre to break Rorshach out of prison. The weakest actor by far played Silk Spectre, but a lot of my dislike may be more towards the character than the performance. Although Doc Manhattan is portrayed using CG, the actor Billy Crudup shot the scenes with the other actors. I like his cool and distant voice, it worked well with character. <br/><br/>Alan Moore refuses to have any involvement with film adaptations of his works, so writers David Hayter and Alex Tse were free to reshape Watchmen into something that could fit within the confines of a 2 ½ hour film. I think the two best decisions made in cutting down the story include removing all the Tales of the Black Freighter from the film, since this really was intended for readers of the comic as a tribute to pirate comics, and wouldn’t have worked in the movie as it lacks any direct connection with the story. I also liked how they and Snyder used the opening frames of the movie to depict the early Minutemen superheroes in technique that allows real-life stills to mimic photographs, but still retain some motion. This way viewers get a taste of what the early superheroes looked like without having to devote lengthy screen time to their backstories.<br/><br/>The biggest change made was to the final climactic scenes in Antarctica as Rorshach, Nite Owl, and Doc Manhattan attempt to foil Ozymandias’ evil master-plan. I actually thought this was overly complex and difficult to understand in book. <a class=\"jsShowSpoiler spoilerAction\">(view spoiler)</a><span class=\"spoilerContainer\" style=\"display: none\">[ Teleporting some freakish alien monster, whose brain was cloned from a human psychotic, into New York City in order to use the massive psychic shockwave from its brain to kill half the city? And this will somehow unite the warring superpowers against a common enemy? Perhaps this was a conscious dig by Moore at the implausibility of master plans by comic book villains? Since the rest of Watchmen seems very realistic within the alternate reality created by Moore, this part of the story struck me as farfetched. So I was actually quite happy when the film version made Ozymandias’ plan more concise and sensible. By simulating nuclear attacks in cities around the world and framing Doc Manhattan for it, this would be more likely to unite the world against Doc Manhattan, thereby completely alienating him from humanity and also eliminating him as a rival to Adrian Veight’s plan to rule the world in the aftermath. <a class=\"jsHideSpoiler spoilerAction\">(hide spoiler)</a>]</span><br/><br/>I’ve heard that many Watchmen fans really hated the film version, but I didn’t feel that way at all. While the film of necessity had to shed many of the side and back stories and incredible background details that make the graphic novel so rich, I think they retained the important aspects of the storyline and focused on them. I also think the film piqued the interest of many viewers to give the graphic novel a try, directing new blood to the comic/graphic novel genre. There are so many disastrous comic book adaptations out there, so Zack Snyder’s film is much better than that.</span>\n",

       "<span id=\"freeText3290102054467276774\" style=\"display:none\">I admire Alan Moore as a public figure and regard how much he apparently shook up superhero comics. That’s not going to make me like <i>The Watchmen</i>. Fundamentally, every character felt like the same uninspired shape, that jaded celebrity in search of catharsis at the expense of someone else. I held out hope for The Comedian to play a dynamic personality, for if ever a universe needed The Joker to kick it in the ass, it was this one. Instead, The Comedian turned out to be the apex cynic, and so I didn't care who killed him, I didn't care why Rorschach was torturing people, and I definitely didn't care about the world going to hell because it was so obviously not in contention. This was just more bleak fiction where, naturally, things go to hell. That's not conflict. That's as destined an ending as happiness at the end of an episode of Care Bears.<br/><br/>There's craft to this, and I won't pretend otherwise. Gibbons throws talent at the project, with striking angles on many panels, a strong sense of color, and moments of brilliance, like Rorschach's mask mimicking the clouds he watches. And Moore obviously wrote this as a dissection, with ample references to the American superhero comics he's critiquing by making people similar to them miserable. It was simply too dreary and monotonous an experience to feel worth it.<br/><br/><i>The Watchmen</i> is considered one of the most important comic books in history, and I won't pretend its hype didn't hurt my experience of it. If not for so many people telling me to read it, I might have dismissed it as more violent maudlin SF. Hype and legacy are not its fault, and I regretted gritting my teeth against those elements.<br/><br/>Because man, the costumes are less spectacular, the origins more bleak, the heroes more despicable and/or self-loathing, the villains almost non-existent, the relationships more strained and the political overtones more blatant than were almost ever seen in mainstream comics before. The comic’s effects were massive: it ushered in a new wave of \"cool,\" where Superman and Spider-Man were lame, and everyone wanted murderous and self-destructive anti-heroes. This movement spawned approximately ten good characters and millions of pages of worthless crap, so I'm still not sure why its existence as critique considered a good thing, but it's certainly a landmark in the history of comic book writers who were so self-loathing they had to call their work \"graphic novels.\" I found it simply painful to read back then and not worth owning today. Behind what has fast become the cliché of comics (and popular film in general) are some slivers of real humanity and possible redemption or at least love, which are vital. Yet new readers who pick this up today are going to wonder what was so important about a slow, long, drawn-out murder mystery surrounding sociopaths, rapists and killers who call themselves superheroes, yet who only care about each other when they die, in a dated dystopia that isn't even half as self-aware, cynical or meaningful as what's being pumped out today.<br/></span>\n",

Rorschach! GAH!), and there were some serious twists in the book that, while I can't say I didn't see them coming, still really affected me strongly.<br/><br/>This is not a comic book for those who want their superheroes infallible icons of Americana. This is a graphic novel in every sense of the phrase. The violence is graphic, but not gratuitously so. It is there for impact upon the reader, and it works. There is nudity and sex, but again, never gratuitous. This novel showcases the sort of \"behind the scenes\" stuff that was never really shown in all the golden and silver age comic books. You almost know reading those old books that there's a seedier underside to the comic world that's only ever hinted at in most older books. Watchmen lifts up the sewer lid and shoves you down the hole to see just how deep the crap can pile up down there.<br/><br/>If I have one complaint about this book it's that I figured out all the twists and turns way too early. But I am an English teacher, after all, and I'm sort of trained to note foreshadowing and whatnot. It was still a fun ride, though, and watching the characters react to what was going on made the whole trip very worthwhile.<br/><br/>Fantastic writing. Art is kind of old school, but still good. The only thing there that consistently bugged me was the original Silk Spectre's hairdo. *shudder*</span>\n",

I don't regret reading it. I can see why this book has such a significant value as a comic. The ending was specially a very nice surprise and I find it very refreshing when I think of all the comic books that exist to depict Superheroes and their struggle to save the world but Seriously, the journey was....BORING! <br/><br/>If I wasn't reading this in a buddy read with my amazing friend, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12222982-roya\" rel=\"nofollow\">Roya</a>, I would have skipped to the very last chapter and I think I would have been FINE. Yes, It's a Hugo Award-winning graphic novel that has appeared in Time magazine's \"All-Time 100 Greatest Novels\" list. I will say it again, I am one of those people that prefer to enjoy what they read. If there is real depth to the story, even better! <br/><br/>I LOVE anti-heroes and this COMIC still bored me. The problem is that I don't think of these characters as real anti-heroes. They are not flawed human beings that are forced into difficult situations and have to make difficult choices. If that's what you want, try \"Batman\"! These characters are mostly pathetic, annoying, selfish, bitchy and need professional help and shouldn't be responsible for their own health and safety, let alone the freaking humanity! There were nice characters too but they either lost their touch along the way or didn't actually get to do anything! When reading an award-wining comic that <i>\"chronicles the fall from grace of a group of super-heroes plagued by all-too-human failings. Along the way, the concept of the super-hero is dissected as the heroes are stalked by an unknown assassin\"</i>, boredom shouldn't be an issue!<br/><br/>It's indeed very unique and definitely has literature value but I simply don't see all the fuss and find it overrated. For me, It was simply too busy trying to be deep and teach the readers a lesson while there wasn't any real depth to it and I actually didn't learn anything. There wasn't anything to learn. I don't even agree with this comic's philosophy, if there is actually any. I am a realistic person that tries to stay positive and I believe while humanity is not perfect, it's not hopeless and in my opinion, the story failed to prove that. It failed to prove the value of life, love and hope!

But every once in a while, I make myself read a certain book for the literature value it has or for the sheer reason that I think I should. *Watchmen\" was one of these cases. I don't regret reading it. I can see why this book has such a significant value as a comic. The ending was specially a very nice surprise and I find it very refreshing when I think of all the comic books that exist to depict Superheroes and their struggle to save the world but Seriously, the journey was....BORING!<br/><br/>If I wasn't reading this in a buddy read with my amazing friend, Roya, I would have skipped to the very last chapter and I think I would have been FINE. Yes, It's a Hugo Award-winning graphic novel that has appeared in Time magazine's \"All-Time 100 Greatest Novels\" list. I will say it again, I am one of those people that prefer to enjoy what they read. If there is real depth to the story, even better!<br/><br/>I LOVE anti-heroes and this COMIC still bored me. The problem is that I don't think of these characters as real anti-heroes. They are not flawed human beings that are forced into difficult situations and have to make difficult choices. If that's what you want, try \"Batman\"! These characters are mostly pathetic, annoying, selfish, bitchy and need professional help and shouldn't be responsible for their own health and safety, let alone the freaking humanity! There were nice characters too but they either lost their touch along the way or didn't actually get to do anything! When reading an award-wining comic that \"chronicles the fall from grace of a group of super-heroes plagued by all-too-human failings. Along the way, the concept of the super-hero is dissected as the heroes are stalked by an unknown assassin\", boredom shouldn't be an issue!<br/><br/>It's indeed very unique and definitely has literature value but I simply don't see all the fuss and find it overrated. For me, It was simply too busy trying to be deep and teach the readers a lesson while there wasn't any real depth to it and I actually didn't learn anything. There wasn't anything to learn. I don't even agree with this comic's philosophy, if there is actually any. I am a realistic person that tries to stay positive and I believe while humanity is not perfect, it's not hopeless and in my opinion, the story failed to prove that. It failed to prove the value of life, love and hope! Yes, there is some insight and wisdom SOMEWHERE in this novel but not enough.*hides from the angry mob*<br/><br/>Lastly, most of the costumes are SUPER lame and I don't care how old this comic is. These are drawings, they didn't have to actually make these costumes back then and I can't get over these characters' awful sense of fashion.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I liked it but it's not really that spectacular and I recommend it if you want to read all the classic and award-wining books in the world or if you are really into philosophy and headache.</span>\n",

And so here is my statement about the book in one sentence: I liked the story but the philosophy behind the novel I did not like. <br/><br/>Watchmen - many people know the idea behind the title 'Who will watch the Watchmen' - but not everyone has read this acclaimed novel. As the title suggests it is a graphic novel that deals with the idea of who exists to watch the superheroes if they go out of control. And really, part of my problem with reading this novel is that when a hero goes out of control you get a villain. I don't subscribe to the idea of the anti-hero like many people. I believe in absolutes and as such I think that the hero is the character who performs more good than he does evil. <br/><br/>In the end of this novel the whole idea of what Watchmen is really trying to convey wraps together. It's really about psychological conflict, about Nihilism and about the Jungian shadow. Many psychological theories I do not subscribe to but find useful to use as discussion points. Because I do not believe that the world is all full of darkness and evil when you strip it down as Watchmen appears to portray. I believe that there is much evil in life but that there is also hope and light for anyone to see. <br/><br/>I did not like either the idea that perhaps in order to create greater good we must compromise. But then I suppose that was the whole point of the novel. The novel was full of compromise made by these super men who are really very human in morality. As Rorschach* says \"No, never compromise.\" <br/><br/>Of course it could simply be the spirit within me that says 'I dislike non Justice League DC comics on the whole.' After all for me while Marvel make few brilliant comics for me to enjoy I do rate them still highly due to the overall story telling in them. DC just don't have the fun of Marvel - they're too dark and gloomy except when the Joker plays with Batman or Superman battles a few enemies. On that note Marvel reigns supreme and The Avengers is one of the greatest films of all. <br/><br/>*Named after the blot test and definitely the most interesting character in the comics as a violent vigilante</span>\n",

While scraping their way through their investigations, the three archaeologists of mystery, enigmatic themselves, deal with their own past and learn more about the creepy metahumans lurking behind practically every oddity on the planet. Ellis seems to take pleasure in turning superheroic icons inside out. Fans will find references and deconstructions from the Golden Age to the post-postmodern comics world. John Cassaday\\'s penciling adapts itself well to the stories, giving intimate barroom chats and epic battles against giant ants equal credibility. While reading Planetary, one gets the sense that superhero comics really do have somewhere to go after being so thoroughly demolished in the \\'80s and \\'90s--and that we\\'d do well to keep reading. --Rob Lightner\\n\\nCollecting: Planetary 7-12<\\/span>\\n  <a data-text-id=\\\"14972117291463956860\\\" href=\\\"#\\\" onclick=\\\"swapContent($(this));; return false;\\\">...more<\\/a>\\n\\n    <\\/div>\\n\\n      <div class=\\'wtrButtonContainer wtrSignedOut\\' id=\\'9_book_209968\\'>\\n<div class=\\'wtrUp wtrLeft\\'>\\n<form action=\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\" accept-charset=\\\"UTF-8\\\" method=\\\"post\\\"><input name=\\\"utf8\\\" type=\\\"hidden\\\" value=\\\"&#x2713;\\\" /><input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"authenticity_token\\\" value=\\\"7OiSSDp9C9v97+QEbrfI7GooiAGoojMWadoLo+kvv1F9DABalLEusAdA7ILtVWz1TrSUKHDnfh6Yqr3AaNbY/A==\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"book_id\\\" id=\\\"book_id\\\" value=\\\"209968\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"name\\\" id=\\\"name\\\" value=\\\"to-read\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"unique_id\\\" id=\\\"unique_id\\\" value=\\\"9_book_209968\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"wtr_new\\\" id=\\\"wtr_new\\\" value=\\\"true\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"from_choice\\\" id=\\\"from_choice\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"from_home_module\\\" id=\\\"from_home_module\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"ref\\\" id=\\\"ref\\\" value=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"wtrLeftUpRef\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"existing_review\\\" id=\\\"existing_review\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" class=\\\"wtrExisting\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"book_origin\\\" id=\\\"book_origin\\\" value=\\\"related_works\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"page_referrer\\\" id=\\\"page_referrer\\\" value=\\\"http://id.search.yahoo.com/search\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"page_url\\\" id=\\\"page_url\\\" value=\\\"/book/show/472331.Watchmen\\\" />\\n<button class=\\'wtrToRead\\' type=\\'submit\\'>\\n<span class=\\'progressTrigger\\'>Want to Read<\\/span>\\n<span class=\\'progressIndicator\\'>saving…<\\/span>\\n<\\/button>\\n<\\/form>\\n\\n<\\/div>\\n\\n<div class=\\'wtrRight wtrUp\\'>\\n<form class=\\\"hiddenShelfForm\\\" action=\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\" accept-charset=\\\"UTF-8\\\" method=\\\"post\\\"><input name=\\\"utf8\\\" type=\\\"hidden\\\" value=\\\"&#x2713;\\\" /><input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"authenticity_token\\\" value=\\\"TNjkTzpBs/npWF66i9liAY9QY6Hyi/9BRAckCIC9otrdPHZdlI2WkhP3VjwIO8YYq8x/iCrOskm1d5JrAUTFdw==\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"unique_id\\\" id=\\\"unique_id\\\" value=\\\"9_book_209968\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"book_id\\\" id=\\\"book_id\\\" value=\\\"209968\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"a\\\" id=\\\"a\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"name\\\" id=\\\"name\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"from_choice\\\" id=\\\"from_choice\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"from_home_module\\\" id=\\\"from_home_module\\\" value=\\\"false\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"book_origin\\\" id=\\\"book_origin\\\" value=\\\"related_works\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"page_referrer\\\" id=\\\"page_referrer\\\" value=\\\"http://id.search.yahoo.com/search\\\" />\\n<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"page_url\\\" id=\\\"page_url\\\" value=\\\"/book/show/472331.Watchmen\\\" />\\n<\\/form>\\n\\n<button class=\\'wtrShelfButton\\'><\\/button>\\n<\\/div>\\n\\n<div class=\\'ratingStars wtrRating\\'>\\n<div class=\\'starsErrorTooltip hidden\\'>\\nError rating book.

This third edition is newly redesigned and features a brand-new cover by Miller - some of his first comics art in years! For Dwight, sometimes standing up for his friends means killing a whole lot of people. Not for revenge. Not because they deserve it. Not because it\\'ll make the world a better place. There\\'s nothing righteous or noble about it. Dwight\\'s gotta kill them because he needs them dead.

He has also written a novel, <i>Voice of the Fire</i>, and performs \"workings\" (one-off performance art/spoken word pieces) with The Moon and Serpent Grand Egyptian Theatre of Marvels, some of which have been released on CD.<br/><br/>As a comics writer, Moore is notable for being one of the first writers to apply literary and formalist sensibilities to the mainstream of the medium. As well as including challenging subject matter and adult themes, he brings a wide range of influences to his work, from the literary–authors such as William S. Burroughs, Thomas Pynchon, Robert Anton Wilson and Iain Sinclair; New Wave science fiction writers such as Michael Moorcock; horror writers such as Clive Barker; to the cinematic–filmmakers such as Nicolas Roeg. Influences within comics include Will Eisner, Harvey Kurtzman, Jack Kirby and Bryan Talbot.<br/></span>\n",

The cold, suffocating dark goes on forever and we are alone. Live our lives, lacking anything better to do. Devise reason later.

Has no pattern save what we imagine after staring at it for too long. No meaning save what we choose to impose. This rudderless world is not shaped by vague metaphysical forces. It is not God who kills the children. Not fate that butchers them or destiny that feeds them to the dogs. It’s us. Only us. Streets stank of fire.
