The unworldly, innocent Ana is startled to realize she wants this man and, despite his enigmatic reserve, finds she is desperate to get close to him. Unable to resist Ana’s quiet beauty, wit, and independent spirit, Grey admits he wants her, too—but on his own terms.<br />\\xa0<br />Shocked yet thrilled by Grey’s singular erotic tastes, Ana hesitates. For all the trappings of success—his multinational businesses, his vast wealth, his loving family—Grey is a man tormented by demons and consumed by the need to control. When the couple embarks on a daring, passionately physical affair, Ana discovers Christian Grey’s secrets and explores her own dark desires.<br /><br />Erotic, amusing, and deeply moving, the Fifty Shades Trilogy is a tale that will obsess you, possess you, and stay with you forever.<br /><br /><b>This book is intended for mature audiences.</b></span>\\n  <a data-text-id=\"4027011783212975873\"

I have nothing against E.L. James. Nothing. She’s said that this series is a fantasy she managed to put on paper and that she never expected it to gain such momentum. Good for her for perusing her dream of writing. <br /><br />If this book also fulfills one of your fantasies, or if you just plain enjoyed it, good for you too. This review is in no way meant to belittle or condemn you for liking these books, and nor is it an attack on the author. These are solely MY OPINIONS about how dangerous FSoG is to society and specifically to women. <br /><br />Needless to say, this book does not fulfill one of my fantasies. It’s pretty much my biggest nightmare.<br /><br />“But it’s just fiction!”<br /><br />No. You can’t use that argument with me. Not anymore. This book is not “just fiction”. This book has become a frigging phenomenon. As I write this, over <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/50-shades-of-grey-by-the-numbers-2013-9?op=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">70 million</a> copies have been sold in the United States alone, hardware stores have <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/crime/2012/06/23/is-fifty-shades-of-grey-dangerous/\" rel=\"nofollow\">run out of</a> “natural fiber” rope and there are even ‘BDSM for Beginners’ classes cropping up in small town America.<br /><br />So excuse me, but I can’t just read this and think of it like a fantasy, not when it’s become a reality for so many people, and not when I was so enraged by what I found within it.<br /><br />Okay everyone, take a deep breath, grab a cup of coffee or a glass of wine and settle in. We’re going to be here for a while. First up is probably the most inflammatory of the statements I’m going to make, so we might as well rip the band aid off.<br /><br /><b>THIS BOOK PERPETUATES THE RAPE CULTURE WE WERE ALL RAISED IN.</b><br /><br />There, I’ve said it. I’m not taking it back and I’m not apologizing. If you’re unfamiliar with this phrase, allow me to elaborate. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_culture\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia</a> defines rape culture as:<br /><br /><i>“A term used within women\\'s studies and feminism, describing a culture in which rape and other sexual violence (usually against women) are common and in which prevalent attitudes, norms, practices, and media condone, normalize, excuse, or encourage sexualized violence.”</i><br /><br />Let’s look at the first half of that definition. As much as we may want to ignore the facts, rape and sexual violence are common in America. According to <a href=\"http://www.rainn.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">RAINN</a>, the nation’s largest anti-sexual violence organization, someone in the U.S. is sexually assaulted every 2 minutes. On average that’s about 207,754 sexual assaults each year. 54% of sexual assaults are not reported, 97% of rapists will never spend a day in jail and 2/3 of these assaults are committed by someone known to the victim.<br /><br />I could go on for days about how prevalent attitudes, practices, and the media condone sexual violence, but I won’t because I’m really going to try and keep my words and links relevant to FSoG. Thankfully, throughout my research, I found several…hundred.<br /><br />The University of California has an <a href=\"http://www.k-state.edu/womenscenter/Emotional%20and%20physical%20abuse/Defining%20a%20Rape%20Culture.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">interesting article</a> about how social and cultural norms perpetuate rape and rape culture. In it, they specifically address how women are conditioned from early ages to be passive and accept and affect certain attitudes and behaviors. Here are some of the social rules they list and elaborate on:<br /><br /><b>1.</b> When spoken to, a woman must acknowledge the other person with a gracious smile.<br /><b>2.</b> Women must answer questions asked of them.<br /><b>3.</b> Women must not bother other people or make a scene because they are uncomfortable.<br /><b>4.</b> When in trouble, it is best to defer to the protection and judgment of men.<br /><b>5.</b> Casual touching or suggestive comments in social settings are meant as a tribute to a woman’s desirability.<br /><b>6.</b> It is the natural state of affairs for men to carry the financial burden of social situations.<br /><b>7.</b> When engaged in a social encounter, it is not proper for a woman to superior in any game, sport or discussion if she wants to be accepted.<br /><b>8.</b> Women should always accept and trust the kindness of strangers if they offer help.<br /><br />There’s a <a href=\"http://fugitivus.wordpress.com/2009/06/26/another-post-about-rape-3/\" rel=\"nofollow\">blog post</a> by Harriet Jacobs that also speaks to this and I urge you to read it in its entirety. In short, it says <i>“…women are raised being told by parents, teachers, media, peers, and all surrounding social strata that</i>:<br /><br /><b>·</b> it is not okay to set solid and distinct boundaries and reinforce them immediately and dramatically when crossed (“mean bitch”)<br /><b>·</b> it is not okay to appear distraught or emotional (“crazy bitch”)<br /><b>·</b> it is not okay to make personal decisions that the adults or other peers in your life do not agree with, and it is not okay to refuse to explain those decisions to others (“stuck-up bitch”)<br /><b>·</b> it is not okay to refuse to agree with somebody, over and over and over again (“angry bitch”)<br /><b>·</b> it is not okay to have (or express) conflicted, fluid, or experimental feelings about yourself, your body, your sexuality, your desires, and your needs (“bitch got daddy issues”)<br /><b>·</b> it is not okay to use your physical strength (if you have it) to set physical boundaries (“dyke bitch”)<br /><b>·</b> it is not okay to raise your voice (“shrill bitch”)<br /><b>·</b> it is not okay to completely and utterly shut down somebody who obviously likes you (“mean dyke/frigid bitch”)<br /><br />Now how do these two examples relate to FSoG? Simply put, Ana, the main character in this series, continuously exhibits the behaviors listed in the rules and seems to have the mentality of those listed in the bullets. She might as well be the case study on which both were based.<br /><br />Early in the book there’s an interaction between her and a young man named Paul, the son of the couple she works for. This is someone she says has <i>“always been a buddy”</i>. Just after they greet each other with a hug, <i>“he releases me but keeps a possessive arm draped over my shoulder. I shuffle from foot to foot, embarrassed. It’s good to see Paul, but he’s always been overly familiar”</i><br /><br />Does she tell him that she’s uncomfortable or step out from beneath his arm? No, that’d be going against everything that rule number three has taught her. Plus, she wouldn’t want to come across as a “mean bitch” now would she? <br /><br />Just after this, Paul asks her out. <i>“Whenever he’s home he asks me on a date, and I always say no. It’s a ritual.”</i> Is it a ritual? Or is it something more than that? Has Ana, like many of us, been conditioned to follow the rules to such a degree that she doesn’t know how to tell him “It’s not okay to keep asking me out”? Is she so terrified of breaking cultural norms and coming across as a mean-crazy-angry-dyke-shrill-frigid bitch that she’ll put up with his pursuit of her indefinitely? Or does she just not know to put a stop to it because she hasn’t been taught to?<br /><br />When she turns him down, yet again, he goes on to say <i>“Ana, one of these days you’ll say yes.”</i> Creeped out yet? You should be. How does Ana respond to this declaration? By escaping the room they’re in and getting back to a crowded store floor. What does this tell us? She felt the need to flee. She felt the need to not be alone with him. Part of her clearly recognized the danger of the situation and the repeated advances of her “friend”. But instead of speaking up, she fled.<br /><br />She never voices her discomfort. She is the submissive, quiet person that society has taught her to be. And 70 million people have read about her and have had these dangerously passive behaviors reinforced, yet again, through her actions, behaviors and words (or lack thereof).<br /><br />How will this same mentality play out in a situation involving sexual assault? I can tell you, because just a few chapters later, she’s sexually assaulted, by another of her “friends”.<br /><br /><i>“José, I’m okay. I’ve got this.” I try to push him away rather feebly. <br />“Ana, please,” he whispers, and now he’s holding me in his arms, pulling me close.<br />“José, what are you doing?”<br />“You know I like you Ana, please.” He has one hand at the small of my back holding me against him, the other at my chin tipping back my head. Holy fuck…he’s going to kiss me.<br />“No, José, stop – no.” I push him, but he’s a wall of hard muscle, and I cannot shift him. His hand has slipped into my hair, and he’s holding my head in place. <br />“Please, Ana, carińo,” he whispers against my lips… He gently trails kisses along my jaw up to the side of my mouth. I feel panicky, drunk, and out of control. The feeling is suffocating.<br />“José, no,” I plead. I don’t want this.</i><br /><br />Luckily, Ana is spared further abuse because the one and only Christian Grey arrives on the scene and saves her. How? By saying <i>“I think the lady said no.”</i> That’s right. Ana can try to push José away and tell him ‘no’ multiple times but that’s not good enough. One sentence from a man and José immediately releases her, bringing us back to rule number four: When in trouble, it is best to defer to the protection and judgment of men. You got that, ladies? Don’t try to fight back because you’ll just be ignored, rely instead on a man. Sort of a catch 22 when the one who’s going to get you into trouble will likely also be a man.<br /><br />Bear in mind that this little scene takes place in the parking lot outside of a crowded bar, just a shout away from salvation. You’re probably wondering why Ana didn’t scream. Why she didn’t fight harder. Well, I’d like to bring up Harriet Jacob’s blog post again because just after her “bitch list” she says this:<br /><br /><i>“If we teach women that there are only certain ways they may acceptably behave, we should not be surprised when they behave in those ways.<br /><br />And we should not be surprised when they behave these ways during attempted or completed rapes.<br /><br />Women who are taught not to speak up too loudly or too forcefully or too adamantly or too demandingly are not going to shout “NO” at the top of their goddamn lungs just because some guy is getting uncomfortably close.<br /><br />Women who are taught not to keep arguing are not going to keep saying “NO.”<br /><br />Women who are taught that their needs and desires are not to be trusted, are fickle and wrong and are not to be interpreted by the woman herself, are not going to know how to argue with “but you liked kissing, I just thought…”<br /><br />Women who are taught that physical confrontations make them look crazy will not start hitting, kicking, and screaming until it’s too late, if they do at all…<br /><br />Nobody obtains the superpower to behave dramatically differently during a frightening confrontation. Women will behave the same way they have been taught to behave in all social, professional, and sexual interactions.”</i><br /><br />Eerie, isn’t it? I sure thought so. Hopefully by now you’re beginning to understand the inflammatory statement this all started with.<br /><br />Not only do Ana’s actions and behaviors throughout the book reinforce the horrible societal conditioning that I mentioned earlier but this series also contains a lot of the other facets of rape culture, like victim silencing. For instance, once she’s collected herself, this happens:<br /><br /><i>“Turning, I glance at José, who looks pretty shamefaced himself and, like me, intimidated by Grey. I glare at him. I have a few choice words for my so-called friend, none of which I can repeat in front of Christian Grey, CEO. Ana, who are you kidding? He’s just seen you hurl all over the ground and into the local flora. There’s no disguising you lack of ladylike behavior.”</i><br /><br />That’s right folks. It isn’t ladylike to yell (shrill bitch). It isn’t ladylike to swear (crazy bitch). It isn’t ladylike to defend yourself after you’ve just been sexually assaulted (mean bitch). Leave that to the menfolk. Surely they’ll defend you. Surely they’ll be the ones to address the fact that you were just sexually assaulted. Men, you know, the other sex, the ones that have been raised to talk about emotions. In public.<br /><br />And while we’re discussing this scene we can’t forget about rule number eight: Women should always accept and trust the kindness of strangers if they offer help. That’s what Christian is to her at this point in the book. A stranger. She’s seen him only three times, in formal or work-related settings, and knows nothing about him other than he’s rich, good looking and that his shopping list resembles those of serial killers (I’ll get to that last part later in the review). But accept his help and trust his kindness she does. She lets this complete stranger remove her from the bar, assuming that as he’s just saved her from a sexual assault, he\\'s not planning one of his own.<br /><br />When she wakes up in his suite the next morning, pantsless by the way, she accuses Christian of stalking her. He defends himself by saying:<br /><br /><i>“…if I hadn’t come to get you, you’d probably waking up in the photographer’s (José’s) bed, and from what I can remember, you weren’t overly enthused about him pressing his suit,” he (Christian) says acidly. <br />Pressing his suit! I glance up at Christian. He’s glaring at me, eyes blazing, aggrieved. I try to bit my lip, but I fail to repress my giggle.<br />“Which Medieval chronicle did you escape from? You sound like a courtly knight.”</i><br /><br />You got that? Stalking’s okay. Because it’s better than being raped.<br /><br />*facepalm*<br /><br />I’m almost at a loss at how to address the rest of this without copious amounts of swearing. How little she’s concerned with her “friend’s” behavior is appalling. That there’s no thought on her end about Christian’s allusion to her rape escape is appalling. How she glosses over it all and makes a fucking joke about it is appalling. It continues by the way.<br /><br /><i>“I would have been fine. I was with Kate.”<br />“And the photographer?” he (Christian) snaps at me.<br />“José just got out of line.” I shrug.</i><br /><br />A shrug is a dismissive gesture, just in case you were wondering. She dismisses sexual assault as ‘getting out of line’. She downplays the severity of what happened. Why does she do this? Because it’s awkward to talk about it? Because it’s scary to think that someone she knows and trusts assaulted her and that when she tried to push him away and said ‘no’ he ignored her? Guess what? It’s always going to suck to talk about. It’s always scary to realize that statistics say that if you’re raped, you’ll know your attacker. But we need to talk about these things because if we don’t, nothing will ever change.<br /><br />And now the grand finale, victim shaming and blaming. You see, José feels bad for what he did. At first, Ana is pissed at him, as she should be, and even after he calls her numerous times and leaves several messages, she continues to ignore him, deciding to “let him stew”. Then the NEXT DAY, this happens:<br /><br /><i>\"The memory of José’s attempted kiss haunts me. I’m beginning to feel a bit cruel not calling him back.\"</i><br /><br />She feels cruel? She feels cruel for not returning the calls of the man that forced himself upon her? Well, of course she does. She\\'s been trained to be gracious and polite. He\\'s addressing her. Rule number one has taught her that she should smile in this situation so it would make sense that she feels bad for not doing so. <br /><br />Two days later, they talk:<br /><br /><i>“Can I see you? I’m sorry about Friday night. I was drunk…and you…well. Ana – please forgive me.”<br />“Of course, I forgive you José. Just don’t do it again. You know I don’t feel like that about you.”</i><br /><br />Here’s where I start to get really angry. <i>“..and you…”</i> what exactly? Were there? Were breathing? Had tits? How can José’s behavior in any way be blamed on Ana? This is the “she deserved to be raped because she was wearing a skirt” mentality that needs to be burned from our collective minds. No one can ever make you do anything. Everything you do, every way you behave is a choice that you and you alone make. So no, there is no <i>“…and you…”</i>.<br /><br />Books like this, with scenes like the ones I’ve spoken about only perpetuate our silence, our ignorance, our discomfort, and our complicity.

Grant them the depth and the severity they deserve. Please\" - I totally agree. <br /><br />I see too many books with rape, torture, and brutal sadism and often it is men against women. And it\\'s just put out there and often no inkling that it is evil and no justice for the perpetrators. I\\'ve read at least a handful of such books just this summer.<br /><br />I can\\'t say what women are being taught as they grow up. I am surprised at everything you cited in your review. <br /><br />But what really needs to be changed is what males are being \"taught\" and have always been \"taught\". They aren\\'t taught well enough that no means no. Or that a female has a right to her personal space which includes all of her body. <br /><br />There is a mentality that pops up in various places including social media that strongly implies that women and girls want to be pushed (not sexually assaulted) by intrusive behavior into sexual liaisons, ranging from just a date, to casual sex. Unfortunately there are enough girls who help perpetuate this thinking. I can think of some Facebook posts where people were sharing their stories of past failed relationships and a recurring theme was the guy could have had it all if he had just made a move which sometimes included a physical overture. This kind of talk, and yes culture, perpetuates the myth, and it is a destructive myth.<br /><br />Also, I think we need to remember that there are few universal truths when it comes to how someone will respond to their upbringing and/or tragic situations in their youth. Serious and thorough discussion of the entire subject is much needed.</span>\\n  <a data-text-id=\"962574287911067386\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"swapContent($(this));; return false;\">...more</a>\\n\\n    <br/>\\n\\n    <span class=\"xhrCommentFooter greyText\">\\n      Sep 06, 2017 05:03PM\\n    </span>\\n\\n  </div>\\n  <div class=\"clear\"></div>\\n</div>\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n  </td>\\n</tr>\\n\\n      </div>\\n\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div class=\"clear\"></div>\\n</div>\\n\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n    <div class=\"elementListBrownSeparator\"></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n  <div class=\"friendReviews elementListBrown\" >\\n    <div class=\"section\">\\n      \\n\\n<div id=\"review_315616160\" class=\"review\" itemprop=\"reviews\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Review\">\\n  <link itemprop=\"url\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/315616160\" />\\n    <a title=\"Wigs\" class=\"left imgcol\" href=\"/user/show/4719641-wigs\"><img alt=\"Wigs\" src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/users/1327112868p2/4719641.jpg\" /></a>\\n\\n  <div class=\"left bodycol\">\\n    <div class=\"reviewHeader uitext stacked\">\\n        <a class=\"reviewDate createdAt right\" href=\"/review/show/315616160?book_show_action=true\">Apr 19, 2012</a>\\n\\n      <span itemprop=\"author\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\">\\n        <a title=\"Wigs\" class=\"user\" itemprop=\"url\" name=\"Wigs\" href=\"/user/show/4719641-wigs\">Wigs</a>\\n      </span>\\n\\n        rated it\\n        <span class=\" staticStars\"><span title=\"did not like it\" size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\">did not like it</span><span title=\"did not like it\" size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p0\"></span><span title=\"did not like it\" size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p0\"></span><span title=\"did not like it\" size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p0\"></span><span title=\"did not like it\" size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p0\"></span></span>\\n\\n          <span class=\"greyText\">&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;</span>\\n          <a class=\"lightGreyText\" title=\"Paperback 9780345803481\" href=\"/book/show/13536858-fifty-shades-of-grey\">review of another edition</a>\\n\\n\\n        \\n\\n\\n          <div class=\"uitext greyText bookshelves\">\\n            Shelves:\\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/4719641-wigs?shelf=book-clubs-and-buddy-reads\">book-clubs-and-buddy-reads</a>, \\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/4719641-wigs?shelf=erotica\">erotica</a>\\n          </div>\\n    </div>\\n\\n\\n        <div class=\"reviewText stacked\">\\n              <span id=\"reviewTextContainer315616160\" class=\"readable\"\\n              >\\n            \\n<span id=\"freeTextContainer11033060273173916877\">You know, I was beginning to wonder if I needed to change some of my two star books to one star.

I read this whole thing. I did not skip anything, I did not skim, I read every word. I bought this book with the intention of giving it the benefit of the doubt. You see, I love erotica, and I\\'m not ashamed to say that I both read (as you see on my 2012 books I\\'ve already read two others) and write it myself. So I was thinking to myself, oh, maybe there\\'s a possibility that even though this is a twi-fiction rewrite, and even though everyone makes fun of it, it could still be a fun little guilty-pleasure read that I can laugh along with.<br><br>NO.<br><br>NO.<br>NO.<br>NO.<br><br>This book is NOT:<br><br>- erotic/sexy<br>- funny, even ironically<br>- endearing<br>- full of sexual taboos<br><br>This book IS:<br><br>- repetitive<br>- plotless (well, you knew that)<br>- painful to get through<br>- depicting manipulative, controlling, and self-destructive as desirable<br>- how to not write a novel<br>- how to gain success by using other people\\'s characters, barely changing them and then laughing all the way to the bank<br><br>Most people know about the twilight matchups so I\\'m not going to go into too much detail, but it was actually quite sickening, how lazy she was to change ANY story details:<br><br><s>Bella</s> Anastasia, a clumsy girl who grew up in <s>Arizona</s> Las Vegas with her mother, then moved to <s>Forks</s> Vancouver, Washington where her <s>dad</s> stepdad lives, while her mother lives with her new husband in <s>Florida</s> Georgia. She has a younger friend named <s>Jacob</s> Jose with a crush on her, and whose dad is friends with her dad, because they are fishing partners and <s>police force</s> army buddies, and who gave her his old <s>truck</s> VW beetle.<br><br><s>Edward</s> Christian, who is adopted and has a sibling named <s>Emmett</s> Elliott and a sister named <s>Alice</s> Mia, also adopted, who live with their parents <s>Carlisle</s> Carrick (really? CARRICK? We couldn\\'t even change the first three letters?) and <s>Esme</s> Grace. Their <s>father</s> mother is a doctor. <br><br><s>Rose</s> Kate and <s>Jasper</s> Ethan are also siblings in this story, but have been changed to be friends of Anastasia, since in Twilight they already have a convenient different last name than the other Cullens.<br><br>Also, he \\'dazzles\\' her.<br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1380238786ra/681587.gif\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"><br><br>I can\\'t even function over the fact that upon preparing this book for publishing she couldn\\'t change one fucking thing to make it even remotely different. That was too hard. TOO DAMN HARD. The similarities in character are so untouched that I am sincerely appalled that she thought it \\'different\\' enough to publish as is. It\\'s quite disgusting.<br><br>Alright, continuing on, and once again, I\\'m sure you\\'ve heard this already: this book is terribly written. Most notably the lack of ability to describe anything other than the few choice phrases she knows how to type. <i>He ran his hands through his hair. I bit my lip. He told me not to bite my lip. Oh jeez. He grabbed me by the chin to make me look up at him. Holy crap. I peeked up at him.</i> Lather rinse repeat. Over. And over. And over. For 500 pages. Then there\\'s the case of multiple personality disorder, where she hears the voices of two distinct other pieces of herself in her head. The subconscious, the one telling her she\\'s not good enough, and the inner goddess, the one that\\'s all into the sex. It\\'s strange because I\\'m also currently reading a book right now, Deadline, where the main character hears a voice in his head because he is literally insane, and it\\'s written almost the exact same way, he talks back to his voice, who presents herself in italics, just as Anastasia talks back to her two italics voices. It\\'s funny because she\\'s supposed to be completely normal, and yet shares the same schizophrenic tendencies as a book about someone who is completely insane. <br><br>This is sense. <br><br>Check out this awesome short paragraph from chapter 24:<br><br>“Through the haze of light, I squint and see Christian leaning over me, smiling. Amused. Amused at me. Dressed! In black.”<br><br>What are these fragments, four in a row. What is this punctuation. GASP AT HIM BEING CLOTHED. Is this supposed to be poetry?<br><br>Let me add some line breaks for poetic interest:<br><br>Through the haze of light, I squint and see ,<br>Christian leaning over me, <br>Smiling. Amused. <br>Amused at me. <br>Dressed! <br>In black.<br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1380238786ra/681588.gif\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"><br><br>That\\'s almost better.<br><br>Let\\'s have another, shall we, from chapter 24 once more:<br><br>“I didn\\'t put that song on my iPod,” he says casually, and puts his foot down so that I am thrown back into my seat as the car accelerates along the freeway.<br><i>What?</i> He knows what he\\'s doing, the bastard. <i>Who did?</i> And I have to listen to Britney going on and on. <i>Who...who?</i><br>The song ends and the iPod shuffles to Damien Rice being morunful. <i>Who? Who?</i> I stare out the window, my stomach churning. Who?<br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1380238786ra/681589.gif\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"><br><br>SAY WHO AGAIN, BITCH. JUST TRY IT, I DARE YOU.<br><br>Okay and now, maybe even worse than the writing (oh hell, nothing\\'s worse than the writing, nevermind) is the lack of plot. Now once again, you already know this. Do I even need to tell you nothing happens? Seeing as it\\'s based off of a book where nothing happens, you can be guaranteed that as we go one step removed, even less happens. <br><br>Here is the part where I apologize to Twilight, where I said, in my page by page commentary below, that 50 Shades was more entertaining. I was at the very beginning. I was young and naïve. I didn\\'t realize. I\\'m sorry. <br><br>You know how The Office kind of got bad after Jim and Pam got together, because there was really nothing you were waiting for after that? This happens by like...chapter 2. You\\'re like...okay....what, now we jut have to watch them whine as a couple for the next zillion pages? Okay. <br><br>I can\\'t even fathom that there are two other books written about this couple. I literally want to open the window and invite birds to eat my eyes out as punishment for buying and reading this book.<br><br>And now for a bit of tiddlybits, I\\'m going to share some information on storywriting that you guys might find interesting, and will help show exactly why 50 Shades has zero plot. <br><br>I went to school for film, and we had story development classes. One thing we were beaten over the head with about is something called the 7 Sentence Story. This will help for any writers that are writing their books to be cinematic or would like their novel to be considered for film purposes (this is by no means a rule, but a really helpful guideline). First, you need a problem, a conflict. A reason to tell a story. Once you have that, your plot should be able to be described in seven sentences thusly:<br><br>Exposition: we are introduced to the protagonist and/or main characters<br>Inciting Incident: something happens that kicks off the conflict, the whole point of the story<br>Plot Point 1: because of the inciting incident, character sets off to do something/correct the problem, etc<br>Midpoint: here in film you might see a montage, but it\\'s a place where either plot point 1 is resolved or there is a transition in the characters way of thinking<br>Plot Point 2: often an even bigger issue arises, or a twist that changes or accelerates the conflict<br>Climax: final showdown or decisions needed to be made<br>Resolution.: everything comes to an end, the conflict is settled in one way or another<br><br>Basically, if you can tell your story in this way in seven sentences, you\\'ll know that A) the main point is clear, B) that your story doesn\\'t wander too much in different directions, and C) that you actually have a plot to stand on, that you can justify there\\'s enough substance there. <br><br>And since that\\'s a lot of vagueness, we\\'ll go with a classic captive/dominant story to show how one tells a story in seven sentences: Disney\\'s Beauty and the Beast. First, the main conflict:<br><br>Conflict: The prince has been turned into a beast and has only a limited time left before he is trapped forever as one.<br><br>And the seven sentence story: <br><br>Exposition: Belle is a smart girl who rejects the advances of Gaston, as she doesn\\'t want to be stuck in a mundane life.<br>Inciting Incident: Belle\\'s father gets lost and captured by the Beast in his castle.<br>Plot Point 1: Belle trades her freedom for her father and is prisoner in the castle.<br>Midpoint: Belle starts to experience feelings for the Beast and is complacent.<br>Plot Point 2: Belle\\'s father is sick, and the Beast decides to let her go, even though he\\'s giving up his chances of being with her.<br>Climax: Gaston comes with an angry mob to destroy the Beast.<br>Resolution: While Beast lays dying, his love for Belle turns him back into a human and he can live with her happily ever after. <br><br>Simple, right? Of course, other things happen, but no doubt you can communicate the main story with just these sentences. <br><br>Okay, so let\\'s try 50 Shades, which, hilariously, has had its film rights bought already. <br><br>Conflict: Anastasia must decide whether to be with a guy who she thinks is super hot but also scares her (This fascinating decision, I tell you what.)<br><br>Exposition: Anastasia is a literary student at WSU.<br>Inciting Incident: Anastasia meets Christian on page 7, and thinks he\\'s hot and mysterious and also frustrating. It is clear they both have chemistry.<br>Plot Point 1, which is sloppy and all over the place: Christian chases her down, brings her to his house and shows her he\\'s into S&amp;M. Also they have sex.<br>Sorta Midpoint, but kind of squished close to Plot Point 1: Anastasia must decide whether to pledge herself to him via contract if she wants to continue seeing him. <br>Plot Point 2: Nah, she\\'s still deciding and whining about how he\\'s kind of scary but continues to have sex with him throughout this whole time. There is no plot point 2.<br>Climax: Well there isn\\'t really one, it\\'s just kind of an all over the place ending...either the more complicated sex scene at the end with the hymnal music or him hitting with her with the belt the next morning, one of the two I guess...<br>Resolution: She says he\\'s too weird and ends it. <br><br>What a complex, thrilling, and incredible plot full of depth. SHOULD I HAVE CUT THAT FOR SPOILERS? OOPS? Did you even care? If you\\'ve gotten this far, nope.<br><br>But guess what. We know that there are two other books and they get together and lesson isn\\'t really learned so AWESOME, COOL. I guess that\\'s how she gets people to buy the next ones because hot diggedy I can\\'t wait to see them get back together and whine some more.<br><br>And let\\'s talk about the sex for a moment. Nothing forbidden actually happens that you\\'ll be like ohhhh how scandalous I want to try that. For the most part it\\'s pretty much all basic stuff or basic toy play, because basically he\\'s taking it easier on her since she\\'s inexperienced. Except for the belt part at the end, I guess, which just doesn\\'t sound fun.<br><br>And you already heard about the tampon, so like, that\\'s not even a surprise (although imo it\\'s not a big deal anyway. Out of all the women having sex on their periods regularly, I can guarantee you there are quite a few men that are tasked with taking the tampon out and throwing it aside.) I was actually more upset about the fact that she is sleeping completely naked in a hotel room bed on day two of her period. As if that isn\\'t going to be a mess in the morning.<br><br>Okay lest I go on as long as the book, you get the point. If you want to see more, my commentary while reading it is below. However, a few things:<br><br>-I cannot stand how much the author being middle aged shows from the point of view of this 21 year old. “I\\'m gonna buy plane tickets...on the Internet.” ARE YOU NOW? WHOAOOOAOAOA. Don\\'t get crazy on us, I might be too overwhelmed by this turn of events. “I fired up my email.” BLAZING SPEEDS REQUIRED.<br><br>-They actually do the “you hang up” “no <i>you</i> hang up” “no <i>you</i>” that gross couples tend to do. And it was, expectedly, gross.<br><br>-Someone on ONTD who liked this book yelled at me because I said that Christian is not a dominant (they also said I wasn\\'t \\'experienced enough to understand,\\' lol okay, like you know who I am, anon.) I still stand by that statement. It\\'s not what he\\'s doing, it\\'s how he\\'s doing it. He is deeply troubled, whiny, and manipulative, and while he does love control, it\\'s for the wrong reasons. He was abused as a child, and sexually abused as a 15 year old and vastly denies it, and because of this he justifies his activities as personal preference when he is in fact a bit too fucked up to currently have a relationship. He ends up making the naïve Anastasia batshit crazy because he continues to string her along, trying to convince her they want the same things, instead of getting himself some help.<br><br>-He gives her the illusion that she has the choice to back out, but then turns around and says ha-ha I\\'m joking but I know where to find you by the way. She goes to visit her mother because she needs a break from him to think, and what does he do? Flies out there, using his roundabout stalker way of finding information about where she\\'s at, like he always does, to meet up, have sex with her and take her out with him. She\\'s supposed to be visiting her mother and having time to think, yet he can\\'t stay away and makes this about HIM, taking her away from time with her mom whom she hasn\\'t seen in 6 months. I can\\'t at this selfish fucking bastard because he just can\\'t stay away.<br><br>It makes me mad just thinking about someone that clingy. Which is another thing that pisses me off, almost everything about their whining and relationship conversations reminds me of everything I\\'ve hated about past relationships I\\'ve had. How does ANYONE enjoy this book?

Let me spell this out for you: <b>BDSM DOES NOT OFFEND ME.</b> If a couple decides to engage in BDSM, that\\'s totally fine. I don\\'t care. It\\'s none of my business, and everyone is entitled to their personal choices. However, I think couples need to come to a proper agreement about these things. They need to have a serious discussion before getting into this stuff, and they should both know about what they\\'re getting into and consensually agree to what they\\'re doing and what the boundaries are. While I have nothing against BDSM, I have a lot of issues with how it was portrayed in this book. I didn\\'t feel that Christian and Ana ever had a good, understanding discussion about the boundaries they were setting. It seemed more that Christian was forcing Ana into something she knew nothing about, and it obviously scared her at times in the book. So, that does NOT scream \"healthy relationship\" to me. So really, stop telling me that I hated this book because I \"don\\'t understand BDSM.\" I do ... and I don\\'t think it was portrayed in a healthy manner in this story. On top of that, even if BDSM did offend me, I hated everything about the book anyway––the plot (or lack thereof), the characters, the writing ... I thought it was all horrible. So yeah. ANOTHER QUICK UPDATE: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o92hv7La9Sk\" rel=\"nofollow\">Laci Green</a> does an excellent job explaining why BDSM is portrayed poorly in this book. <br><br>ON TO THE ACTUAL REVIEW: <br><br>Well...<br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1380238786ra/681582.gif\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"><br><br>This book was unbelievably horrible.<br><br>I mean, <i>really</i>. I hated this book more than I hate House of Night. Possibly even more than I hate <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7778981.Halo__Halo___1_\" title=\"Halo (Halo, #1) by Alexandra Adornetto\" rel=\"nofollow\">Halo</a>. At least those books attempted to have a plot. <i>Fifty Shades of <s>What the Fuck</s> Grey</i> didn\\'t even do that.<br><br>Okay, let\\'s back up a little. I started hearing about this book probably a month or two ago. I kept seeing it all over Goodreads, and Twitter, and Amazon, and all that jazz. So I was like, \"Wow, this book is super popular. Wonder if it\\'s any good!\" I look up the plot here on Goodreads, and I\\'m like, \"Uhh ... This sounds like ... porn.\" And soon I was hearing about how ridiculous it is, and yada yada.<br><br>Yet, I was still tempted to read it, because I kind of wanted to see what the hype was about. And some of my friends were like, \"Ooh we should all read it and see how dumb it is!\" ... And you know me, I always like snarking about stupid books.<br><br>But it turns out, this is hardly even a book. A bit of backround research will quickly inform you that <b>this book is actually a very long piece of <i>Twilight</i> fanfiction</b>. I kid you not. The author originally posted it on Fanfiction, using Bella Swan and Edward Cullen as the two main characters\\' names. Because it was apparently too sexy, she then took it off Fanfiction and posted it on her own website, swapping Edward and Bella\\'s names with Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele. (<b>Update:</b> If you think I\\'m exaggerating, just read <a href=\"http://dearauthor.com/features/industry-news/master-of-the-universe-versus-fifty-shades-by-e-l-james-comparison/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a>. The original piece of fanfiction and <i>Fifty Shades of Grey</i> are <i>89% the same text</i>.)<br><br>So, this book is literally a weird, porno version of <i>Twilight</i>––only with the characters\\' names changed, and the author replaced the vampires with ... sex. If that doesn\\'t send you running, I don\\'t know what will.<br><br>But really, this book even fails as fanfiction. There were parts where E.L. James pretty much just copied scenes word-for-word out of <i>Twilight</i> and swapped the names. <br><br>Take the two scenes below––one of them from Twilight and one of them from Fifty Shades of Grey––for example. In both of them, the couple is at a restaurant. A waitress walks up to take their order, and she is dazzled by the handsomeness of the male character. She walks away. And the couple has almost word-for-word the same conversation afterwards.<br><br><b>From <i>Twilight</i>:</b><br><br><i>\"Um––\" She shook her head, blinking. \"Your server will be right out.\" She walked away unsteadily.<br><br>\"You really shouldn\\'t do that to people,\" I criticized. \"It\\'s hardly fair.\"<br><br>\"Do what?\"<br><br>\"Dazzle them like that––She\\'s probably hyperventilating in the kitchen right now.\"<br><br>He seemed confused.<br><br>\"Oh, come on,\" I said dubiously. \"You have to know the effect you have on people.\"<br><br>He tilted his head to one side, his eyes were curious. \"I dazzle people?\"<br><br>\"You haven\\'t noticed? Do you think everybody gets their way so easily?\"<br><br>He ignored my questions. \"Do I dazzle you?\"<br><br>\"Frequently,\" I admitted.</i><br><br><b>Now, the scene from <i>Fifty Shades of Grey</i>:</b><br><br><i>“Thank you sir. Will that be all?” Leandra whispers, looking anywhere but at the two of us. We both turn to stare at her, and she flushes crimson again and scuttles away.<br><br>“You know it’s really not fair.” I glance down at the Formica tabletop, tracing a pattern in it with my index finger, trying to sound nonchalant.<br><br>“What’s not fair?” <br><br>“How you disarm people. Women. Me.”<br><br>“Do I disarm you?”<br><br>I snort. “All the time.”</i><br><br>See what I mean? This isn\\'t just fanfiction. It almost verges on outright plagiarism. <br><br>But anyway, that\\'s just a brief introduction to the book. So, let\\'s look at the other things at which this book utterly fails.<br><br><b>The Plot:</b><br><br>Anastasia \"Ana\" Steele is a 21-year-old woman who is just finishing college. Her best friend is supposed to interview a wealthy entrepreneur named Christian Grey, but falls ill on the day of the interview. So, she sends Ana in her place. Of course, Christian ends up being a sexy man––but also an arrogant bastard. Ana is like, \"Wow, what a jerk. But he\\'s so HAWT.\"<br><br>Naturally, Christian then begins stalking her like a maniac. He shows up at some café where she\\'s eating, then at her job ... Then, one night, she gets super drunk at a club and calls him. He <i>tracks her cell phone</i> and hunts her down. He then essentially kidnaps her, takes her to a fancy hotel, and takes off her pants (but doesn\\'t have sex with her). Oh, and of course he buys her a bunch of nice new clothing to replace the ones she vomited on.<br><br>The next day, he takes her on a helicopter ride to his giant mansion. Soon, he says he wants to show her something, and then leads her into a torture chamber. ... You read that correctly. <b>He has a fucking medieval torture chamber in his house.</b> (And the \"fucking\" part is quite literal...)<br><br>So, you\\'d expect Ana to be like:<br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1380222758ra/586469.gif\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"><br><br>Instead she\\'s just like, \"lol How kinky.\"<br><br>And ... well ... this all happens within the first 80 pages or so. Soon after, Christian finds out that Ana is a virgin and feels the need to amend this \"situation\" as he refers to it. What follows is about 300 pages of sex scenes that escalate in weirdness. Occasionally the two of them go out to eat food, or Ana goes somewhere to visit someone and Christian stalks her ... same old, same old. But most of it is just the bizarre BDSM sex scenes.<br><br>(And a quick note to trolls: It\\'s not the BDSM that offends me, it\\'s the weird way in which the sex scenes are written.)<br><br>I guess the only \"conflict\"––if you could really call that––lies in Christian\\'s backstory. Apparently he is into this S&amp;M stuff because his virginity was taken away by one of his mother\\'s friends, and then they had some weird affair together ... and ... yeah, I don\\'t really understand how it\\'s related, either so I won\\'t try to explain it. So anyway, if there is any conflict in this book at all, it\\'s Ana\\'s occasional, bizarre jealousy of this Mrs. Robinson character. Towards the end of the book, she and Christian argue about it, and Ana is convinced that the two of them are still a couple and ... it\\'s just stupid and not really worth discussing. <br><br>So, that is pretty much the whole story.<br><br><b>The Characters:</b><br><br>Both of the main characters are Mary Sues. Or I suppose Christian is a Gary Stu. Whatever. Anyway, here are just a few Mary Sue traits of both:<br><br>Ana:<br>- thinks she can\\'t fall in love<br>- has no interests in anything besides British literature<br>- is a klutz but doesn\\'t really have any other realistic flaws<br>- hates herself and sees herself as totally undesirable, yet everyone is in love with her<br>- has never been drunk before<br>- is a virgin, yet is miraculously awesome at sex<br>- is apparently gorgeous and in good shape, even though she repeatedly claims to <i>never work out at all</i><br><br>Christian:<br>- \"doesn\\'t do romance\" and has so-called \"commitment issues\"<br>- is richer than God, and so can buy whatever the fuck he wants at the drop of a hat––like first editions of really old books, laptops that haven\\'t come out yet, fancy cars (all for Ana of course)<br>- plays piano exceptionally well<br>- is allowed to be a bastard because he\\'s attractive<br><br>But on top of being clichéd, Mary Sue-ish characters, these two are just bland and terrible people to begin with.<br><br>There isn\\'t really much to say about Ana. She obviously has no idea what the difference between romance and abuse is. She even admits several times that Christian seems like a stalker, and that he\\'s rather scary ... plus, she has many golden opportunities to run away from Christian. Yet, she sticks with him because \"he\\'s so freaking hot!\" apparently. Seriously, reading her train of thought is just painful. <br><br>Christian ... is just a sexist, abusive bastard. Did I mention that besides all the creepy sex stuff, <b>he makes Ana sign a fucking contract</b> (which is like ten pages long) basically turning her life over to him. <b>This contract allows him to choose what she eats and wears, how much she exercises, and how often she shaves/waxes. He also forces her to take contraception, and he forbids her from masturbating because he \"wants all her pleasure.\"</b><br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1380238786ra/681583.gif\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"><br><br>... No. Just freaking NO. Dang, this guy makes Edward Cullen look like the best boyfriend ever. I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever come across a main male protagonist who was so controlling, sexist, demanding, and disgusting ... and then is portrayed as being \"sexy.\" NO. NO, THAT IS NOT SEXY. THAT IS PLAIN, CLEAR ABUSE.<br><br>(EDIT: Okay, trolls. So no, Ana does not actually sign this contract. I misspoke (or mis-wrote, whatever). However, the point is that Christian <i>wants</i> her to sign this contract which does actually say all of those things. And even though Ana does not sign it, Christian still does whatever he wants with her, so to me I don\\'t find it very important whether she signed the contract or not. The point is, Christian actually wrote this ridiculous document spelling out everything he wants a woman to do for him, and tries to pressure Ana into signing it––and yes, I think that is abusive. Moving on.) <br><br><b>The writing:</b><br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1380222758ra/298539.gif\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"><br><br>Where to start?<br><br>This book is just written like the stream-of-consciousness of a 15-year-old. All Ana can seem to do in her narration is comment on how sexy Christian looks, and throw in a lot of \"Holy shit!\"/\"Holy crap!\"/\"Holy fuck!\"s. I read this in ebook format, so I looked up how many times each of these phrases was used.<br><br>\"holy shit\" = 65 times<br>\"holy crap\" = 54 times<br>\"holy fuck\" = 45 times<br><br>Anyway ... just some little gems to give you a taste of what the writing is like:<br><br><b>\"My scalp prickles at the idea that maybe, just maybe, he might like me. After all, he did say he was glad Kate didn’t do the interview. I hug myself with quiet glee, rocking from side to side, entertaining the possibility that he might like me for one brief moment.\"</b><br><br><b>\"She blinks at me with surprise – I very rarely throw my toys out of the pram\"</b> --&gt; Some weird British saying?<br><br>OOH HERE\\'S MY FAVORITE:<br><br><b>\"Travis is José’s friend and gopher\"</b> --&gt; BAHAHAHAHAHA OH GOD. I think the word you meant was \"go-fer.\" This, E.L. James, is a GOPHER:<br><br><img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1380238786i/681584.jpg\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"><br><br>Anyway, moving on ...<br><br><b>\"My mouth goes dry looking at him... he’s so freaking hot.\"</b><br><br><b>\"Oh my... he really is, quite... wow. As I touch his hand, I’m aware of that delicious current running right through me, lighting me up, making me blush, and I’m sure my erratic breathing must be audible.\"</b><br><br><b>\"Grey smiles a dazzling, unguarded, natural, all-teeth-showing, glorious smile.\"</b> --&gt; Would you like some sentence with those adjectives?<br><br><b>\"My mouth pops open as I gasp and swallow at the same time.\"</b> --&gt; Pretty sure that\\'s impossible…<br><br><b>\"Two orgasms... coming apart at the seams, like the spin cycle on a washing machine, wow.\"</b> --&gt; Uhhh ... WHAT.<br><br><b>\"He’s my very own Christian Grey flavor popsicle.\"</b> --&gt; Yes, this means what you think it does.<br><br><b>\"His fingers circle my ear, and very softly, he tugs my earlobe, rhythmically. It’s so sexual.\"</b><br><br><b>\"I blush scarlet.\"</b> --&gt; Okay, she uses this phrase like five hundred times. What other color would she blush?! Green? Purple?<br><br><b>\"body-shattering orgasm\"</b> --&gt; lolwut<br><br><b>\"Now please do not refer to yourself as ‘some woman I fuck occasionally’ because, quite frankly it makes me MAD, and you really wouldn’t like me when I’m angry.\"</b> --&gt; Isn\\'t that something the Hulk says? Well besides the \"woman I fuck occasionally\" part…<br><br>And THEN there was this really odd description E.L. James kept using where Ana kept referring to her \"inner goddess\" ... whatever the hell that means. Somewhere in the story, \"inner goddess\" was swapped with \"subconscious\" ... but in both cases, Ana keeps talking about this imaginary person living inside her and it\\'s just ... well, see for yourself:<br><br><b>\"and my very small inner goddess sways in a gentle victorious samba\"<br><br>\"My inner goddess glares at me, tapping her small foot impatiently.\"<br><br>\"My subconscious scowls at me... fucking – not lovemaking – she screams at me like a harpy.

Unwelcome, apparently because her friend is beautiful, even when she has the flu...? What a petty, jealous cunt. <br><br>The only thing that made the first 4% of this book tolerable was the fact that I read it aloud to my younger brother, and his frequent commentary was amusingly distracting. Once he gave up, however, I had to travel the rest of the road alone. What a painful journey it was. <br><br>My first impressions of Ana were bad (deservedly so).

Turns out, I found something about 15% through. I went back and counted, and kept track throughout the rest of the book, and do you have <i>any</i> idea how many fucking times Ana said \"Oh my\" in this monumentally bad missive? Do you? I\\'ll tell you; 79! 79 motherfucking times. \"He pulled me back against his chest...<i>oh my</i>.\" \"He began kissing a trail down my belly, <i>oh my</i>.\" \"He\\'s an insufferable douchenozzle, <b>oh my</b>!\" (I\\'m just thankful that neither lions, tigers, nor bears were brought into this mess at any point.)<br><br><a href=\"http://tinypic.com?ref=fly5bm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">\\n  <img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1380238785ra/681564.gif\" alt=\"Image and video hosting by TinyPic\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"></a><br><br>About halfway through, I wished I\\'d been keeping track of the word \"crap\" because Ana is constantly saying/thinking it.

Were the sex scenes well-written? Well, none of it was particularly well-written. The sex scenes could be kind of...honestly, they were kind of boring. I\\'ve had more exciting sex myself, so I guess reader response to the sex scenes is dependent on reader experience. There\\'s nothing revolutionary here, and a lot of it is just plain unrealistic. I mean, come on, he pretty much jackhammers her hymen and she walks away with nothing more than a passing, pleasant soreness? Riiiight. How about the time he gives her a handjob with a soapy washcloth? Hello? Apparently neither one of them has ever heard of a urinary tract infection. Oh, or we could talk about her first time giving Christian a blowjob, during which Ana established herself as some kind of Queen of Deepthroat.<br><br><a href=\"http://tinypic.com?ref=2vxizuu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">\\n  <img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1380238785ra/681569.gif\" alt=\"Image and video hosting by TinyPic\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"></a><br><br>Anyone wanna hear about the tampon scene? Oh, you\\'ve already <i>heard</i> about the tampon scene? Yeah, same here, although hearing about it and reading the actual scene are a bit different.

We\\'re supposed to believe that this girl has gone 21 years neither having had sex <i>nor</i> masturbating? Hm. Well, Christian\\'s supposed sexual prowess makes a bit more sense now, as does Ana\\'s assertion that he has a giant bologna wand. She has absolutely <i>zero</i> experience, and she\\'s never once had anything \"in <i>there</i>\".

It\\'s the plot. Thin as it is, it\\'s still there, its core message being that, given enough time, you can change someone. While I don\\'t have any problem with this if all you\\'re trying to do is help them to lose weight or quit smoking, when you\\'re talking about an emotionally and (dangerously close to) physically abusive relationship, sending that kind of message is ridiculous and irresponsible. Christian is controlling, possessive, condescending, and cruel. He doesn\\'t allow Ana to behave as she normally would, and Ana just puts up with it, insistent that if she can give him what he wants, when he wants, as often as he wants, she can eventually begin to pull his strings. Will it work? In the books, probably. In real life? No. Almost never. How many misguided women are going to waste their lives on some emotionally retarded prick because they\\'ve read shit like this and think this kind of fucked-up fairytale will come true for them?

She\\'s constantly afraid he\\'s going to beat the crap out of her, and with good reason as he, on more than one occasion, tells her he\\'s going to/wants to.<br><br>Potential rape is downplayed. Ana\\'s friend, <s>Jake</s> Jose, starts pushing himself on her rather vehemently when they\\'re both drunk. Ana repeatedly says no, but Jose just keeps trying to go in for the kill. Admiral Chaps busts on up with his riding crop, however, and saves her. Ana (understandably) avoids Jose for a while after that, and when her other friend asks her why, all Ana says is, \"He made a pass at me.\" Later on, she and Jose are friends again, the \"attempted kiss\" forgotten. *Sigh*<br><br>Rapists appear to be a theme. Christian tells Ana that he gets off on having complete and total control over another person. This is not just in the bedroom, but in Ana\\'s overall life.

His condescension, his control, his insane jealousy, his threats.....and now....imagine he looks like this:<br><br><a href=\"http://tinypic.com?ref=2mk13d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">\\n  <img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1380238785i/681578.jpg\" alt=\"Image and video hosting by TinyPic\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"></a><br><br>Still turned on? <br><br>The end of the book was absolutely hilarious, with Ana fleeing in emotional tumult because Christian can\\'t give her what she needs (<b>love!</b> *sniff*).<br><br><a href=\"http://tinypic.com?ref=2zftnhv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">\\n  <img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1380238785ra/681579.gif\" alt=\"Image and video hosting by TinyPic\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"></a><br><br>And we\\'re treated to her alternately being angry about the pain and humiliation she faced at Christian\\'s hands, and chastising <i>herself</i> for being a failure and for being <i>mean</i> to Christian. It really is <i>classic</i> abuse mentality. Yet I see her being touted by some as \"strong and independent\". <br><br>It\\'s this kind of ignorant trash that sets feminism back decades. Women who defend this book are, however unwittingly, participating in some of the most blatant misogyny I\\'ve ever witnessed, giving the impression that some women enjoy being debased, abused, and controlled (<i>outside</i> of a consensual Dom/sub relationship). This is not a book about BDSM, this is a book about one sick, abusive man and his obsession with a young, naive invertebrate. It\\'s a book about a girl who has absolutely no sense of self, who sacrifices any pretense of individuality in order to hold onto a man who doesn\\'t even show her the faintest glimmer of respect. It\\'s about two attention-starved individuals with the emotional maturity of toilet paper convincing themselves that their relationship is \\'like, the best thing ever, OMG\\'. It\\'s trite, insulting, and dangerous. I fear for any impressionable young women who read this and think that <i>this</i> is how an ideal relationship should operate. If nothing else, it should be issued as a guidebook to mothers around the world to show their daughters the kind of man to avoid at all costs. This book does <i>good</i> men (and indeed, all of humanity) a disservice. <br><br><a href=\"http://tinypic.com?ref=34erprp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">\\n  <img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1380238785ra/681580.gif\" alt=\"Image and video hosting by TinyPic\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"></a><br><br>*Sigh*<br><br>A bestseller.

Whatever it was that brought on this knee jerk purchase seems to have mercifully left me with enough common sense to say I will not be continuing on with this series.<br><br>Recently I discovered one of my favorite publishers, Random House, has picked up Fifty Shades of Grey and made this statement:<br><blockquote>\"An orig\\xadi\\xadnal work, and said to us that James had war\\xadranted the books were, indeed orig\\xadi\\xadnal. Mes\\xadsitte added she was “aware of the nar\\xadra\\xadtive that [50\\xa0SHADES] started as dif\\xadfer\\xadently titled piece of fic\\xadtion, but that they were and are two dis\\xadtinctly sep\\xada\\xadrate pieces of\\xa0work.\"</blockquote><br>I\\'m sorry, but I\\'m going to have to call bull shit on that. Fifty Shades of Grey and Master of the Universe (the original fan fic) are essentially the same thing. The biggest difference being Edward and Bella\\'s name being replaced with Christian and Anastasia respectively. And I would know this because I have both and while I was reading, I would occasionally switch back and forth between the two without difficulty. I\\'d go through and give you examples myself, but other people have done it already <a href=\"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/65785689/50ShadesofWTF.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://dearauthor.com/features/industry-news/master-of-the-universe-versus-fifty-shades-by-e-l-james-comparison\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. So if you must read this book, do yourself a solid and find the fan fic online. You even get the second book too!<br><br>I know some people claim this has no similarities to Twilight and got dammit, I\\'m allergic to all the bull shit. Do I really need to point this all out? Because it looks pretty obvious to me. The mannerisms of the characters are exactly the same. They even say similar things the original characters say. The whole \"dazzle\" line and Edward asking Bella to trust him. Her mother being remarried with the same inability to maneuver her way around a kitchen. Bella is still trying to save Edward from himself due to his troubled past. Edward still stalks and controls Bella, only now he gets to hit her when she gets out of line.<br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1380238789ra/681634.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"><br><em>*facepalm* Shall I beat them both? Yes?</em><br><br>I struggled to come up with a proper review for this book and couldn\\'t figure out why I was feeling rather uninspired to write one. And then I figured it out. I was left so disgusted by this book that I wanted to purge the memory of its existence from my mind. With a rusty nail. Every time I thought of the book my brain cells would go on strike, yelling obscenities at me. \\xa0Anyway, I thought Bella and Edward\\'s relationship couldn\\'t get anymore fucked up than Twilight. I stand corrected. If I were to describe FSoG in one sentence it would be this: Fifty Shades of Grey is like Twilight on steroids, high on ecstasy, in a dirty little corner. A very dirty corner. With badly written sex. Lots.<br><br>Sexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsex....oh......sexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsex...<br><br>Fifty Shades of Grey tells the story of the beautiful (but of course she doesn\\'t know it), naive virgin, Anastasia Steal after she is suckered into interviewing the Greek god, Christian Grey. Of course, sparks fly and for some unknown reason he can\\'t seem to stay away from this incredibly, unremarkable girl. \\xa0Ana discovers Christian is into BDSM and desires her as his submissive fuck buddy.<br><br>There are a myriad of problems with this novel, many of which ironically can be found in Twilight. <em>Never saw that one coming!</em> Christian/Edward is still a controlling bastard, only now he hides behind his BDSM practices to camouflage his abusive tendencies. However, Ana doesn\\'t see it that way. She thinks of him as a broken person and it\\'s her duty to fix him. Even when he says things like this:<br><blockquote>\"I want to hurt you. But not beyond anything you couldn\\'t take.\"</blockquote><br>Can you believe she let\\'s him beat her after that? And please don\\'t even bother to tell me that it\\'s just BDSM. No, just fucking no. Ana is genuinely afraid of Christian and is never entirely comfortable with the \"punishment\" aspect of their relationship. But Christian just manipulates her with sex to continue the relationship. And that\\'s what really gets me. I just have a hard time believing a virgin would somehow become a sex goddess overnight, because that is exactly what happens. When she first is introduced to his kinky lifestyle and tells him she is a virgin he immediately tells her he needs to handle that \"situation\" before they could continue. What?! Since when is your virginity a \"situation?\" But, that\\'s not really the kicker. Oh, no, because that is when we are introduced to Ana\\'s two best friends. Everyone say hi to:<br><br><a href=\"http://s181.photobucket.com/albums/x95/shellnick2003/?action=view&amp;current=photo-1312.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">\\n  <img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1380238789ra/681635.gif\" alt=\"Photobucket Pictures, Images and Photos\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"></a><br><br>Sexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsex....oh......sexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsex...<br><br>Anna\\'s inner goddess, who always cheers her on when Christian wants sex or wants to punish her. She\\'s also quite annoying, doing back flips at the mention of anything sexual related. <em>Simmer down.</em> Where did she come from exactly? Ana is in her twenties and has never felt the urge to have sex with anyone until Christian comes along with his whips and chains?!<br><br>And... Ana\\'s sub-conscious, who hides behind couches when it comes time for her beating. When it comes to Ana having sex with Christian, well, her sub-conscious only has one thing to say,<br><br><a href=\"http://s181.photobucket.com/albums/x95/shellnick2003/?action=view&amp;current=photo-1824.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">\\n  <img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1380238789ra/681636.gif\" alt=\"Photobucket Pictures, Images and Photos\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"></a><br><br>So after the \"situation\" is handled, Ana has to sign a \"contract\" agreeing to his sexual demands and also outlining things she won\\'t do. It was pretty pointless considering he still got what he wanted and she never signed the damn thing. He exploits her, stalks her and abuses her! She cries after sex. She is afraid of him being angry! Even when he is angry at something else, she thinks it\\'s her. Her reasoning for allowing him to hit her as his therapy is because she\\'s afraid to lose him. That is not a reason for agreeing to a BDSM lifestyle!

I’d rather spend the time searching for ways to remove this utter nonsense from my memory. However, this book is so bad that I feel the need to warn others from this drivel. Luckily, I did not buy this garbage. I do not even know what overcame me to read it and I can only blame a momentary lack of judgment on my part.<br><br>What baffles me is the <b>scary</b> fangirlgasm following this book. So what’s causing it a hit? I can only come up with ‘twilight’. Doing some research, this book was originally posted online as a twilight fanfic! Yes, a twilight fanfic. The fact that this book’s source material isn’t a good piece of literature just shows what you should expect from this book. And dubbing it a twilight fanfic and promoting it as such is no doubt raising the bar on the sale figures. What has the world come to? *headdesk* Whatever’s causing its success; I can safely say it can’t be the book itself.<br><br><b>Everything you could possibly imagine is wrong with this book!</b> The execution and the characters. And the writing. And the plot (wait, was there one?!?)<br><br>Firstly, it has been said a countless number of times how abusive Bella and Edward’s relationship was. And it is arguably the most anti-feminist portrayal of any relationship. FSoG simply continues this unhealthy view and promotes an even more abusive and degrading relationship towards women, targeting older women (and possibly even teenage girls who know no better). Oh dear god, I hope teenage girls do not jump on this disturbing bandwagon. <br><br>Surely, it is degrading to ask a woman to sign a contract where ‘she is now the property of the Dominant, to be dealt with as the Dominant pleases’ and ‘submitting [herself] to any sexual activity demanded by the Dominant…without hesitation or argument’ – especially when you take into consideration the fact that she would be signing up to something she has not yet experienced and knows little about as she is still a virgin. This is <b>not</b> something that should be promoted as desirable or idealistic. This book cheapens what feminists have fought for years! Don’t get me wrong I wouldn\\'t deprive women of their right to express themselves sexually, nor to act upon their desires but I shudder at the thought of women aspiring to a relationship where she will take part in various things that she is not comfortable with and at times, even when she’s genuinely in fear of taking part, simply because she finds the guy ‘hot’.<br><br><img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1380238786i/681592.jpg\" width=\"350\" height=\"200\" alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"><br><br>The <b>plot</b> - I’m not even sure if there was one. 50% of the book is spent talking about sex/the contract and the other 50% is made up of clumsily written sex scenes. <a class=\"jsShowSpoiler spoilerAction\">(view spoiler)</a><span class=\"spoilerContainer\" style=\"display: none\">[FSoG starts of with Anastasia Steele agreeing to interview the billionaire, Christian Grey. Miss Steele is instantly captivated by Mr Grey’s dashing looks and within 2 days she falls in love with him. Mr Grey for some unfathomable reason can’t keep away from her and reveals to her his secret kinky lifestyle. The two spend the rest of the romantic evening calmly discussing the contract that allows him to fuck her senseless. She reveals to him that she’s a virgin and his only response, he needs to handle that ‘situation’. <i>Really?!?</i> The next 4 days, he gets to do exactly what he wants, he stalks her, abuses her and punishes her by spanking her several times. Quotes that spring to mind – “Please don’t hit me…don’t be angry with me…don’t want you to spank me” <i>Aww, isn’t that romantic?</i> Atleast, she finally sees some sense and walks out.  <a class=\"jsHideSpoiler spoilerAction\">(hide spoiler)</a>]</span><br><br>The <b>writing</b> is dull and unimaginative. It reads more like a diary – he did this, I did this. The constant repetitions are enough to make someone suicidal! I hope I never have to see the words, ‘my subconscious’ and ‘my inner goddess’ ever again or so help me god! The sex scenes were terrible and frankly a little disturbing to put down on paper – an incident with the tampon springs to mind.<br><br>The <b>characters</b> are simply absurd in this book. <br><br><s>AnaBella SteeleSwan</s> Anastasia Steele irked me quite a lot and reading this book from her point of view was no picnic in the park. Finding out that she is 21 years old was a shock – she reads like a dim-witted 12 year old, who’s vocabulary doesn’t extend further from ‘jeez’, ‘oh crap’, ‘damn’, ‘oh my’, ‘holy cow’ and even the constant reference to her vagina as <i>‘down there’</i>. I found nothing remotely interesting about her. She has most of Bella’s traits and then some – she’s boring, clumsy and downright bitter, even towards her best friend, Kate. The only other word I can use to describe her is a ‘scrounger’ – can’t she afford her own clothes? <br><br>She’s too gullible and a hypocrite. She’s weak-willed and succumbs so easily for my liking. And I’m pretty sure she suffers from some form of mental disorder – schizophrenia perhaps? She constantly refers to what she calls her ‘inner goddess’ and her ‘subconscious’, who either cheer her on when there’s an opportunity for sex or take opportunities to call her a ‘dirty hoe’!<br><br><a class=\"jsShowSpoiler spoilerAction\">(view spoiler)</a><span class=\"spoilerContainer\" style=\"display: none\">[ “My subconscious asks me, her eyebrow figuratively raised…<br><br>My subconscious is metaphorically screaming at me, arms folded, leaning on one leg and tapping her foot in frustration…<br><br>My subconscious is figuratively tutting and glaring at me over her half moon specs…<br><br>My subconscious - she’s doing her happy dance in a bright red hula skirt…<br>______________________________________________<br>My inner goddess glares at me, tapping her small foot impatiently<br><br>My inner goddess is doing the merengue with some salsa moves<br><br>My inner goddess is lying on, eating grapes and tapping her fingers,<br><br>My inner goddess is spinning like a world-class ballerina, pirouette after pirouette<br><br>My inner goddess jumps up and down with cheerleading pom-poms, is doing back flips in a routine worthy of a Russian Olympic gymnast, is standing on the podium awaiting her gold medal, has back flipped off the podium and is doing cartwheels around the stadium, bounces up and down like a small child waiting for ice cream, looks like someone snatched her ice cream. My inner goddess is not pleased”  <a class=\"jsHideSpoiler spoilerAction\">(hide spoiler)</a>]</span><b>Kill me now!</b><br><br>I swear Kate was a much more interesting character and would have made a better female lead, but like the other few characters she was mentioned only for the sake of a story.

Absolutely horrifying, utter trash. A waste of trees, bookshelf space and precious, oh so very fucking precious braincells. Honestly, why is this even published? Every single book store in Sydney is promoting this tripe, claiming it to be some kind of awesome romance novel. Are you absolutely shitting me? There is nothing romantic at all about this \\'book\\'. And I don\\'t mean the BDSM erotica themes, I mean the fifty levels of abuse in this friggin\\' thing. <br /><br />In fact, that\\'s what this book should be called. \\'Fifty shades of absolute-fucking-insanity-and-abuse\\'. I know at least every one star reviewer has taken the title and created their own pun with it, but fuck it, I\\'m jumping on the bandwagon too. <br /><br />Before I decided to read this (God help me), I kept seeing it everywhere I went, and the book store where I work was involved in the promotion among other book store chains. Typical. All me and my co-workers knew that it was smut, and a hell of a lot of it too. We even turned the book into a drinking game, and it goes as thus: Flip to a random page of the book. If it\\'s something dirty, take a drink. I do not recommend this game, for one could die from alcohol poisoning within the first round. But if you\\'re feeling adventurous... by all means. Glad I could be of service to your crazy party ideas. <br /><br />But anyway, let\\'s cut to my opinion of this abomination of literature. I decided to read it because it sounded like garbage, and I haven\\'t written a review about garbage in too long. I owed something to the people who actually found me worthwhile to follow on Goodreads. So I decided hell, I\\'ll review this. <br /><br />Brain cells I will never, ever, EVER, get back.<br /><br />This is literally the worst book I have ever read, and I say that about many books. But this is the worst book for a damn good reason. Let\\'s talk about what I hated about this book. The bottom line is I hated absolutely everything. And I\\'m not saying that to be funny, I\\'m saying that out of all seriousness. I didn\\'t find a single redeeming quality in this book. With the Hush, hush series we at least had the unintentional hilarity and the awesomeness of Marcie. In Twilight we had that chick who wanted to kill Bella and Tyler\\'s van. Fifty shades of Grey has no such redeeming qualities. The characters are bland and merely props to set the stage for fucking weird BDSM-ing, and the plot was lost somewhere in the vagina of the author\\'s wet dream. (Believe me, I feel weird for even typing these words.) <br /><br />Not to mention, even though everyone already knows this, this was originally a Twilight fan fiction called \\'Master of the universe\\' or some shitty, stupid title like that. How did such a thing get published? What, Twilight wasn\\'t horrible and abuse-glorifying enough, so we had to kick it up a notch with publishing \\'Master of the universe\\'? Are you people serious? Why is it that dumber and dumber things are getting published? Quality is almost non-existent. Fucking hell. <br /><br />But before I rant on for hours about that, let\\'s talk about the characters. Oh, I mean props. Yeah, props is more appropriate. Why? Because the characters, for all the personality they had may as well have been props. <br /><br />Our first main prop is Ana, aka Bella Swan. The plain, virginal wallflower who thinks lowly of herself whilst everyone around her just seems to freaking worship her. She is also clumsy, reads books, has divorced parents, doesn\\'t get along with her step-father, and is a brain dead moronic twat. Remind you of anyone? I wonder who you\\'re thinking of. That is a humdinger, isn\\'t it? I\\'m amazed how many women are not pissed off with her complete lack of sense and self-respect. She lets a man abuse her physically and emotionally, and allows him to satiate his ever-growing need to control her completely, passing it off as some cute obsessive habit. And even if she has doubts and runs away, she comes running back to him only seconds after. How are people not pissed off about this? Seriously? Not to mention she has zero personality, zero brain-cells, and zero common sense. Her character serves no purpose other than becoming some abusive asshole\\'s sex toy. <br /><br />And let\\'s not forget our second main prop, Christian Grey, aka Edward Cullen, aka creepy-stalker-sociopathic-megalomaniacal-abusive-horrifying-asshole. The fact that he has fangirls in the real world has pretty much ruined my faith in mankind, and the new generation. Christian Gray pretty much pushes the limits that Edward Cullen, Patch, Daniel and others have yet to push due to their PG ratings, but fuck does Christian Grey push those fucking limits. He physically abuses Ana, and it somehow gets excused on the account that she was briefly aroused by it. SERIOUSLY PEOPLE?? SERIOUSLY?? Fuck my life. He also decides what she should eat, what she should wear, how she should act, speak, communicate with him, where she can and can\\'t go or what she can and can\\'t do, threatens her constantly even with physical violence, and the list goes on. I kid you not. He even has this set out as a contract (which by the way is repeated at least 5 times in the fucking book). Here\\'s another example of how romantic this mother fucker is:<br /><br /><i>\"I like the control it gives me, Anastasia. I want you to behave in a particular way, and if you don\\'t, I shall punish you, and you will learn to behave the way I desire.\"</i><br /><br />See? Romantic as freaking Mel Gibson. And by the way, the women who find this guy romantic need some serious therapy. Seriously. Harsh I know, but finding this guy romantic is like like excusing the actions of a child-molester because he has nice hair. This is not romantic. This is ABUSIVE and WRONG on sooooo many levels.<br /><br />I don\\'t know why they decided to plant this book in the general romance section. This is not romantic. And don\\'t give me the \\'IT\\'S MEANT TO BE BDSM, SO IT\\'S SUPPOSED TO BE ALL DOM VS SUB\\'. This goes way beyond the good ol\\' BDSM theme and just ends up treading into abusive territory. Christian takes these aspects into the relationship where he ends up not only controlling a woman sexually, but also emotionally, and deliberately moulding her into not just a sex partner, but an ideal of what he wants her to be and leaves her no room for her individuality and instead brands it as \\'punishable\\'. That\\'s not part of the BDSM jig. I\\'m sorry, but it\\'s not. Why people even call this romantic is beyond me. I already mentioned the abusive aspects of this so called relationship, but other than that it was a relationship built on air. Since neither of the characters had any personality outside their sex drives, they had nothing that they saw in each other. They couldn\\'t relate to each other, they didn\\'t share any common interests, they didn\\'t do any good for each other, outside the sexy stuff. And at the end they want to pass it off as though the two are actually in love? Give me a break. Watching people get swooped at by magpies is more romantic that this garbage.<br /><br />The plot? There was no plot. Seriously, I could not find it. ANYWHERE. I searched and searched but alas, my search has left me unrewarded. Let me explain in a quick paragraph how this book goes:<br /><br />\\'Girl meets some guy. Some guy is hot. Girl thinks some guy is hot. Hot some-guy shows up where girl who thinks some-guy is hot works. Hot some-guy asks out girl, takes her virginity. Stuff happens. Hot some-guy introduces girl (who thinks he\\'s hot, by the way) to his BDSM sex dungeon, and the next half of the book is spent pondering whether or not girl (who thinks some-guy is hot, in case it wasn\\'t mentioned enough in the book) wants to indulge in hot some-guy\\'s fantasies. Also the hot some-guy takes complete control over girl (did I mention she thinks he\\'s hot?) who seems to be totally okay with it. More stuff happens. Girl gets spanked too hard, breaks up with hot some-guy. The end.\\'<br /><br />That\\'s it. That\\'s the whole book. And the whole \\'Ohhh Christian has secrets\\' bullcrap in the blurb? Bullcrap. His secrets are mentioned in only 5% of the book and drive the plot nowhere. The book is only about how some asshole wants to control some stupid girl. The other characters are barely relevant. They were just more props whose only role was to be interested in the \\'relationship\\' between Ana and Christian. They didn\\'t seem to be interested in anything else. They could be buttering toast and thinking \\'I wonder how hard Christian is fucking Ana right now.\\'<br /><br />An absolute waste. The media might be promoting this tripe as the new hero of literature, but this is and always will be just another wart on the ass of literature, along with Twilight and all its\\' descendants. You know what they say, you can polish a turd, but it will still be a turd. </span>\\n  <a data-text-id=\"10853642213190794069\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"swapContent($(this));; return

I did write.<br><br>I\\'m actually not shitting you. I thought it would be as easy as sitting down and writing some crap on Wordpad (alright, calm down, this was the noughties) and I wrote a lot of crap: I tried to write a <i>play</i>, and then I tried poetry, and then I wrote short stories, before eventually expanding into novels. <br><br>Novels is a stretch. I wrote about a hundred single-spaced pages and to my present-day horror, made my family read it. <i>And they actually did</i>. Remember all those embarrassingly awful school projects you did when you were thirteen? Or even just those embarrassingly awful things you did in general when you were thirteen? I feel the same level of shame when I think of my little preteen self, handing this pile of shit over to my sister and thinking I actually had something.<br><br>About a year later, with zero knowledge of how publishing works, I posted it straight into a bunch of indie publisher\\'s slushpiles. A vanity publisher replied to me and told me they didn\\'t want my work, and I did the undoable: <b>I argued with them</b>.<br><br>As I write this, I\\'m practically convulsing with embarrassment. Vanity Publisher, if you\\'re reading this, please forget I ever existed. But if you can\\'t do that, at least give me an alias when you tell all your friends about that dumb kid who sent you the book about pyromania without having done any research.<br><br>In some ways, having read this book, I finally feel like I identify with that vanity publisher: I read someone\\'s irredeemable shit and hated it, but then they tried to defend it and I got so mad I broke a window with my face.<br><br>(Peeps, if you think E.L. James hasn\\'t tried to defend this shit, then you need to get on YouTube and watch some pleading vids from the publisher.)<br><br>I just...<br><br>I haven\\'t read a book this awful since <i>Revealing Eden</i> (but let\\'s not open that can of worms). It was like an acid trip. Am I reading this, I thought? Is this actually a published book? Are people actually parting with money for this slab of steaming garbage?<br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1380238788ra/681604.gif\" width=\"250\" height=\"200\" alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"><br><br>I feel like this book insulted me, really. I feel like it spat in my face, because what reader-respecting author would create a protagonist this redundant and awe-inspiringly dense, expecting an audience to love and respect her? It\\'s as if someone took an ice-cream scoop and relieved Ana of her brain. How could you...? Why would you...? Why is she...?<br><br>I just...<br><br>I have no words. I have no words to explain this protagonist. None at all. I have more to say about the love interest, who\\'s like a more threatening Charles Manson but with only one brainwashed follower (Ana). This guy goes to the hardware store and buys like chains and lime and shit and Ana doesn\\'t think this is weird?<br><br>What the fucking fuck?<br><br>And of course there\\'s the whole \"inner goddess\" shit and Ana thinking that it\\'s sexy to wear a chunky knit sweater and be strapped into a vehicle, and then using the word \"vagina\" during a sex scene. <br><br>\"Oh, he touched my vagina\".<br><br>Yeah, excuse me while I tame my boner!<br><br>I felt so uncomfortable reading this book. Now, let\\'s be honest here: I read porn. Of course I read porn. Anyone over sixteen who says they\\'ve never looked at or read porn is talking out of their ass. But this book made me feel uncomfortable, and here\\'s the kicker: <i>I read it alone</i>. I was reading it alone in my living room, and I felt uncomfortable inside my own head. What the fuck does that tell you?<br><br>I don\\'t want to start yammering on about the way this book is written. It\\'s written like horrendous fanfiction. There are spelling and punctuation errors, stupid turns of phrase, random asides, stilted dialogue, awful physical descriptions, weird pacing, and I don\\'t know, like a thousand instances of brand dropping and band-naming which gives the book this bizarre cheap and dated quality that really takes away from what little redeeming features it might have had.<br><br>What are the redeeming features? I don\\'t know. The blurb sounds interesting. That\\'s about it.<br><br>But what is it about this book that\\'s captured the attention of so many millions of people across the world? The absurdly stupid protagonist? The pushy, obsessive, totally unrealistic love interest? The relationship in which only one party is actually interested in BDSM, and the other is incredibly resistant to it, but is forced into it? The terrible writing? The awful cover art? The cheap, thin binding? A story so convoluted, so ridiculous, so totally immature it could only ever have been born from <i>Twilight</i>?<br><br><img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1380238788i/681605.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"><br><br>There is nothing enjoyable about this book.

FSoShit is garbage and if I had read a paperback I would have burned the <s>fucking</s> offending thing. It\\'s a total mystery to me why this book ever saw the light of day because, let\\'s face it, the writing is incredibly juvenile. The story and characters are extremely poorly written and I couldn\\'t for the life of me connect with the dumb, clumsy, naïve and immature heroine. <br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1423758883ra/13668170.gif\" alt=\" photo oie_w4nfAreoEsub_zps86t5yfay.gif\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"><br><br>Also, the slimy whacko didn\\'t deserve to be called hero. Christian is a highly manipulative, abusive and stalker-ish asshole. His whispers didn\\'t endear him to me either. He came off as a total creep. I honestly don\\'t understand what Ana saw in him, yet on the other hand, I didn\\'t get it why Christian would stalk that bland and vapid wallflower. In any event, these two deserved each other and Ana obviously enjoyed Grey\\'s blunt and crude approach.<br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1423758883ra/13668171.gif\" alt=\" photo oie_iX6eIKB2WOVb_zpsaoup4pqs.gif\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"><br><br>The whole contract business was pretty much mind-boggling. I don\\'t believe that a healthy and consensual Dom/sub relationship could be based upon such crappy and ridiculous rules.<br><br>Christian, the rich Superman (sarcasm), deflowered our wallflower in a way that\\'s not even worthy of losing any words over that pathetic fuck. So, you did guess right. I neither found the sex to be hot nor erotic. At.All. Thus, I\\'d better buy him a ticket to the next Mars expedition stat. That would ensure that Mr. Grey would not return to our cozy place called Mother Earth.<br><br>FSoG lacked depth and emotion big time. Except of disgust and anger I felt nothing towards these pathetic main protagonists and their fucked up trip bored me to tears.<br><br>The winking smileys irritated the hell outta me and all that inner goddess shit made me almost blow a fuse. Jesus.Fucking.Christ. Would you give me a break already? I\\'ve read a variety of erotica books and I do enjoy great smexin\\' that comes with some kind of depth and great characterization. However, I\\'m not sorry to say that FSoG is ranking among the worst erotica books I\\'ve ever read.<br><br><b>What\\'s seriously bugging me as well is the fact that the general public thinks that FSoShit provides almost every woman\\'s erotic fantasy. I don\\'t criticize readers who loved this book but I\\'m criticizing the media coverage. I don\\'t appreciate it when these people claim to know that\\'s what a general majority of women love to read and want in real life (or in the bedroom for that matter). Seriously? Never. Ever. FSoG is bad erotica. It\\'s bad BDSM too. <br><br>When people say FSoG is “empowering women in their sexuality,” then I think something is seriously wrong. Never ever could this story empower me in my sexuality. What in God’s name is on their minds? I can do it all by myself with my very healthy hand, and I can gladly say that my boyfriend is empowering me just fine and is taking care of my needs. Thank you very much. BTW, my boyfriend is not an abusive and manipulative stalker. Oh, yes, now it dawns on me…my boyfriend is real.</b><br><br>Bottom line, the barely there plot and the characters were overly shallow, underdeveloped, immature and boring. The amateurish writing killed any desire to read anything else by this author in the future. And last but not least, my inner goddess was so fucking relieved when she had to quit eventually. It was a very tedious and crappy experience and I wish I had never bought this book, let alone attempted to go through this rubbish. I was in dire need of bleaching my brain.<br><br>Christopher Hitchens said…<br><br><b>\\n  <i>Everybody does have a book in them, but in most cases that\\'s where it should

A hot dude that melts a woman’s panties off with just one look. The perfect sex toy set out to conquer an innocent girl. Grey (the sick f*ck) is considered one of the hottest characters out there but he doesn’t get to me. His dominance is too much for me to handle and his attitude tends to be annoying and slimy. Plus he’s just wrong in the head so there’s no need to add more about this creep.<br><br><img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1380238786i/681594.jpg\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"><br><br><b>Anastasia</b> is an immature insecure desperate idiot who wants to become the whore of Babylon. She just wants to listen to her inner goddess (wtf?!) and have creepy monkey sex with Grey. She has no personality nor will whatsoever, she gets excited over the smallest and most idiotic things you can imagine and even though she sees how wrong Grey (the sick f*ck) is, she still goes for it. She’s always mooning over Grey like he’s some kind of god that she’s supposed to worship. He tells her that he doesn’t want a serious relationship just sex and she’s still ok with it. Why? Just because he’s hot? He’s a damn disgusting pervert. He hurt her the first time they made love, she was a virgin for Christ’s sake (<i>and I don’t buy the crap with it being perfect, surely she had vaginal cracks after that</i>), and is treating her like a slave. Even though he’s a successful businessman and he’s rich and famous he still can be a psychopath. Just watch <i>American Psycho</i> and you’ll know what I’m talking about.<br><br>Now to pick on one of my biggest problems regarding this book: <b>THE CONTRACT</b>. WTF may I ask? Signing paperwork in order to have sex with him? Is he a natural hazard or what? I get the whole <i>Hey look at me I’m badass, I have my own company and helicopter gig</i> ‘cause the guy is stinking rich but the contract??? Isn’t anyone getting angry with this?<br><br><img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1380238786i/681595.jpg\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"><br><br>I guess not...<br><blockquote>\\n  <i> “Why would I do that?”<br>“To please me”</i>\\n</blockquote><br>Wtf??

If Grey wasn’t so hot would you still have given it such great ratings? I doubt you would. So this means that the reason why you love the book is mainly Christian Grey being hot and an uber alpha? Shallow much? Or maybe you’re into all the Christian Grey induced monkey sex and torture. Psycho much? <br><br>But who am I to judge.<br><br>This book is just a desperate woman’s sick fantasy to be treated like a sex slave. I’m sorry but it doesn’t work for me. I DNF’d this because I find it disgusting and degrading. <br><br>P.S. (I have to mention this because some people are too smart to get it) <b>MY REVIEW IS STRICTLY RELATED TO FIFTY SHADES OF GREY AND NOT BDSM IN GENERAL</b>.

For those of you who have not read the book, well, you’ll have to buy a copy to understand the inside joke. <br /><br /><b>CONTRACT</b><br />Dated this day 28th day of October, 2011<br /><br /><b>BETWEEN</b><br />P.A. LUPTON (reader, and fan, Fifty Shades of Grey by E L James)<br />And<br />ALL FANS OF EROTIC, CONTEMPORARY ROMANCE<br /><br /><b>EXPECTATIONS</b><br />Readers can expect to find within the pages of this book a flawless rendering of the internal, psychological struggles of a novice submissive in a BDSM relationship. Anastasia Steele is an innocent to sexual relationships, let alone BDSM relationships. E L James captures perfectly her fears, confusions, insecurities, and internal conflicts as she deals with falling in first love with a man who epitomizes the meaning of dominant.<br /><br /><b>CHARACTERS</b><br />The reader shall discover within this novel two of the most well thought out and in depth characters. The hero Christian Grey admits that he is “Fifty shades of Fu*#&amp;ed up,” which makes the reader want to delve in and learn about each of those fifty shades. The heroine Anastasia Steele is a study in contradictions: smart but naïve, innocent yet sensual, independent yet submissive, and these paradoxes keep the reader captivated and eager to learn more. <br /><br /><b>THE PARTIES AGREE AS FOLLOWS</b><br />Upon signing this contract, you (the fan) agree to proceed to your nearest bookstore, or e-book retailer, and immediately purchase a copy of Fifty Shades of Grey. I (PA Lupton) warrant that upon reading said copy a multitude of emotions will inevitably ensue. I further warrant that disappointment will not be one of the aforementioned emotions. Your signature on this contract further indicates your accord in following the rules set out in APPENDIX 1 to this agreement.<br /><br /><b>SIGNATURE</b>______________________\\t<br /><br /><b>APPENDIX 1<br />RULES</b><br />1.\\tPlease ensure that you have Kleenex prepared when you read this novel as build up of emotions will unavoidably lead to the inadvertent shedding of tears.<br />2.\\tMake certain to schedule ample time for reading as once you begin you will be unable to put your book down. Be warned: If obligations force you to cease reading prior to completion, for long periods of time, it will inevitably lead to impatience and frustration.<br />3.\\tIMPORTANT: Cold liquids, ice, cool cloths, or any cooling equipment such as central air or electric fans should be close at hand. Reading the romantic (i.e. sex) scenes in this book without these cooling devices will certainly lead to overheating. <br />4.\\tEnjoy!<br /></span>\\n  <a data-text-id=\"9545371717354440275\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"swapContent($(this));; return false;\">...more</a>\\n\\n          </span>\\n        </div>\\n\\n\\n      <div class=\"reviewFooter uitext buttons\">\\n          \\n\\n<tr class=\"no_border feedFooterReview\" id=\"update_comment_stuff_Review228482599\">\\n  <td colspan=\"2\">\\n    <div class=\"updateActionLinks\">\\n        <a class=\"right flag\" rel=\"nofollow\" id=\"flag_link228482599\" title=\"Flag this review as inappropriate.\" href=\"/flagged/new?resource_id=228482599&amp;resource_type=Review&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F10818853-fifty-shades-of-grey\">flag</a>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      <span class=\\'likeItContainer\\' id=\\'like_container_review_228482599\\'><a id=\"like_count_review_228482599\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/rating/voters/228482599?resource_type=Review\"><span class=\"likesCount\">870 likes</span></a>&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"jsLike like_it gr-button gr-button--small\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/new?remember=true&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F10818853-fifty-shades-of-grey\">Like</a></span>\\n&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;<a href=\"/review/show/228482599?book_show_action=true&amp;from_review_page=1\">see review</a>\\n    </div>\\n\\n\\n    <div id=\\'comments_for_review_228482599\\' style=\\'display: none;\\'>\\n<div class=\\'brown_comment\\'>\\n<span class=\"loadingLinkSpan\"><a class=\"loadingLink\" data-remote=\"true\" href=\"/review/228482599/comments?reverse=true\">View all 300 comments</a><span class=\"loadingAnimation\"></span><span class=\"loadingError\"></span></span>\\n</div>\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n  </td>\\n</tr>\\n\\n      </div>\\n\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div class=\"clear\"></div>\\n</div>\\n\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n    <div class=\"elementListBrownSeparator\"></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n  <div class=\"friendReviews elementListBrown\" >\\n    <div class=\"section\">\\n      \\n\\n<div id=\"review_185500323\" class=\"review nosyndicate\" itemprop=\"reviews\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Review\">\\n  <link itemprop=\"url\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/185500323\" />\\n    <a title=\"Molly\" class=\"left imgcol\" href=\"/user/show/5016310-molly\"><img alt=\"Molly\" src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/users/1298913510p2/5016310.jpg\" /></a>\\n\\n  <div class=\"left bodycol\">\\n    <div class=\"reviewHeader uitext stacked\">\\n        <a class=\"reviewDate createdAt right\" href=\"/review/show/185500323?book_show_action=true\">Jul 16, 2011</a>\\n\\n      <span itemprop=\"author\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\">\\n        <a title=\"Molly\" class=\"user\" itemprop=\"url\" name=\"Molly\" href=\"/user/show/5016310-molly\">Molly</a>\\n      </span>\\n\\n        rated it\\n        <span class=\" staticStars\"><span title=\"did not like it\" size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\">did not like it</span><span title=\"did not like it\" size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p0\"></span><span title=\"did not like it\" size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p0\"></span><span title=\"did not like it\" size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p0\"></span><span title=\"did not like it\" size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p0\"></span></span>\\n\\n          <span class=\"greyText\">&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;</span>\\n          <a class=\"lightGreyText\" title=\"Paperback 9781612130286\" href=\"/book/show/13609263-fifty-shades-of-grey\">review of another edition</a>\\n\\n\\n        \\n\\n\\n    </div>\\n\\n\\n        <div class=\"reviewText stacked\">\\n              <span id=\"reviewTextContainer185500323\" class=\"readable\"\\n              >\\n            \\n<span id=\"freeTextContainer6603245087356564226\">Really.. blah, blah.

(by which i mean i have looked a man in the eye - you don\\'t need to know my life.) so it\\'s very tame. if disney were going to make a bdsm movie, they would use the same contract. <br><br>because real suspension?? <br><br>it looks more like this: <br><br><a class=\"jsShowSpoiler spoilerAction\">(view spoiler)</a><span class=\"spoilerContainer\" style=\"display: none\">[<img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1380238788i/681620.jpg\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"> <a class=\"jsHideSpoiler spoilerAction\">(hide spoiler)</a>]</span><br><br>or this:<br><br><a class=\"jsShowSpoiler spoilerAction\">(view spoiler)</a><span class=\"spoilerContainer\" style=\"display: none\">[<img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1380238788i/681621._SX540_.jpg\" width=\"500\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"> <a class=\"jsHideSpoiler spoilerAction\">(hide spoiler)</a>]</span><br><br>or this:<br><br><a class=\"jsShowSpoiler spoilerAction\">(view spoiler)</a><span class=\"spoilerContainer\" style=\"display: none\">[<img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1380238788i/681622.jpg\" width=\"500\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"> <a class=\"jsHideSpoiler spoilerAction\">(hide spoiler)</a>]</span><br><br>what they do is what teenagers do when they are still in their experimentation stage. okay - so that\\'s out of the way - this is bondage-lite. <br><br>moving on to the rest of it, because this had a lot fewer scenes of erotic journeying than i had feared. there are still plenty, but the first scene isn\\'t until after page 100, and after that, it isn\\'t taking over the whole book. but there\\'s still enough for you people who aren\\'t reading this for the articles. <br><br><b>twilight</b><br><br>there is a lot of debate about whether this reads like twilight, because it started out as twilight fanfic. some people say \"yes\" some people say \"nooo.\" i am here to break that tie. <br><br>OF COURSE IT READS LIKE TWILIGHT!!! <br><br>are you mad?? ALL the twilightisms are there: the \"i\\'m bad for you\" speeches, the emphasis on smells, the ineffable attraction of a perfect and wealthy man to an underdescribed, clumsy and tongue-tied female who is all \"who, me??\" with all of the self-doubt and self-esteem issues, all the \"how can such a perfect specimen fall for li\\'l ole me??\", the seeecrets and the endless endless repetitions.and those repetitions make the book so frequently annoying.but that\\'s not her fault, not if that is what she is going for. it\\'s actually quite remarkable that she was able to mimic meyer\\'s style to that extent. sure, it\\'s irritating as hell, but as an homage, it\\'s quite accomplished.i have decided to interpret her linguistic quirks as homage, not as weak writing. feel free to disagree - it\\'s just my take on it. (although the writing is frequently weak in other areas as well. i am just feeling generous.) <br><br><br><b>language</b><br><br>first of all, e.l. james is british. and yet - because this is <i>twilight</i> fanfic, she had to set it in washington state. but no one told her how we talk. pssst - we use our present perfect tense differently than you do. yes, even those of us who are/were lit majors. when americans say things like \"i\\'ve not been there\" etc, it sounds pompous. sorry to you americans who do talk like that, but it does. it sounds affected. especially in erotic fiction set in washington state. <br><br><b>miscellaneous</b><br><br>there are so many gasps in here, it may as well have been titled <i>the great gaspy</i>. i personally have never heard a man gasp with lust in response to something i have said. how do i do this? does he have a breathing disorder? why are his eyes always darkening? i have never noticed this phenomenon, but it is a staple of romance novels. i was not aware this could actually happen. biting of the lips, linen, inner goddess, subconscious, medulla oblongata, blushing, control freak... get used to these words. there are at least 50 occurrences of these words on every page. <br><br><b>characters</b><br><br>i do not understand his attraction to our heroine. she never says anything interesting, except in her emails. those emails are the best part of this book. she shows more personality there than in any conversation, and that\\'s just odd, to me. i\\'m not sure why i was expecting much more from a character whose favorite book is <i>tess</i>, because you know how i feel about that book, but i was glad to see thomas hardy pop up frequently, even if it is my least favorite of his books. <br><br>and christian is also unstable and mercurial and full of anger towards peccadilloes. and - god - his food issues. even without his sexual needs, this guy is a piece of work. i\\'m not sure i could put up with someone so changeable, even if he was an uncommonly gorgeous billionaire who wanted to buy me old and expensive books... gotta draw the line somewhere.<br><br>plus, once i saw the leather bed, i\\'d be outta there. that\\'s just gross, all sticky and germ-encouraging. <br><br>i don\\'t know - i wanted to write a much better review for this book - there was so much i wanted to say, but i am feeling lazy right now. i feel weird giving it three stars, because there was so much about this book i didn\\'t like, but the three-stars here is more of a \"i thought it was going to be so much worse than it is\" and my deeply charitable heart which overlooks weaknesses in favor of an author\\'s zeal. <br><br>but here, enjoy this link of gilbert gottfried reading this book aloud:<br><br><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.collegehumor.com/embed/6770096/gilbert-gottfried-reads-fifty-shades-of-grey\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.collegehumor.com/embed/677...</a><br><br>and here are three other options, if you\\'d rather giggle:<br><br><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/908354916\" rel=\"nofollow\"> fifty shades of grey pussy cats</a><br><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/373635586\" rel=\"nofollow\">a coupla shades of taupe</a><br><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/377721300\" rel=\"nofollow\">fifty shames of earl grey</a></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></span>\\n  <a data-text-id=\"16289821134919415844\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"swapContent($(this));;

Paging through this \"published\" version makes me more embarrassed for the author than I was when it was in the fanfic domain, and it DEFINITELY made me lose respect for The Writer\\'s Coffee Shop.<br /><br />Most distracting is the schizophrenic voice of the main character, Ana. In one paragraph, Ana\\'s words sound like those of a quasi-literate teenager; in the next paragraph she uses uber-literate words like \"gamine\". Are we supposed to believe that she\\'s naive or sophisticated? Un-self-aware or articulate?<br /><br />Add in culture confusion: Ana is supposed to be American, but the author (who is from the U.K.) keeps having Ana use Britishisms! Her roommate isn\\'t \"sick\" like American people are, she\\'s \"ill\"; Ana doesn\\'t \"grab her bag\" before going out the door, she \"gathers her satchel\". Ana\\'s voice fails to consistently ring true for an American girl.<br /><br />Yet, the worst literary crime is the outright misuse of language. Says Ana at one point: \"The elevator whisks me with terminal velocity to the twentieth floor.\" Um...terminal velocity occurs when the downward force of gravity equals the upward force of drag, and it can\\'t be reached by a controlled-speed mechanism that draws an object upward (such as an elevator). Even if the author didn\\'t know this, the editor should have caught it.<br /><br />The problems don\\'t end there. From cliches (without a lick of irony or humor, Ana is described as putting the \"pedal to the metal\" as she drives), to awkward sentences, to nonsensical metaphors, this work is amateurish. There\\'s nothing wrong with being an amateur, but there IS something wrong with charging people money for something that hasn\\'t been professionally edited. If this author wants to be taken seriously, she should take the time to learn about writing craft and align herself with an editing house that will turn her writing into serious work. </span>\\n  <a

That\\'s what I wanted from this book, and that\\'s what I got, so for me, that was enough.<br /><br /><i>Post Post Script on October 9, 2012</i><br />I greatly appreciate all those who have defended my review in the comments section - especially those who completely disagreed with my opinion of the book. For those making hateful comments: you don\\'t like the book, people who did are apparently driving you crazy, so my advice: stop reading all the positive reviews!! Age-old rule: if you don\\'t have anything nice to say, don\\'t say anything at all.<br /><br /><i>Post Post Post Script on January 13, 2017</i><br />Almost 500 comments on this review, but none for awhile, so not sure why I\\'m coming back to it now. I started reading the most recent comments though and my own review, and frankly I wanted to delete some of it, but figured that was ridiculous at this point. I wouldn\\'t write this same review were I to read it now, but that was what I thought that morning at the time right after I read it, so it is what it is. Finally watched the movie recently, which is probably what brought me round to this, and for the record: yes, Christian does f*cked up shit (they don\\'t even get to all of it in the movie) and were this real-life, I would have advised her to get a restraining order, because wtf. But it\\'s not. Anyway. I wrote what I wrote; I was in my early 20s; I liked it. Peace xo<br /><br /><i>Sincerely, Juliana</i></blockquote><br /><u>\\n  <b>* Actual Review Begins Here *</b>\\n</u><br /><br /><b>\\n  <i>5+ stars.</i>\\n</b> Wow. Wow, wow, wow. I still feel somewhat under the spell of this book. I\\'m so ... <i>beguiled</i> by it ;-) (book allusion). It was honestly an amazing read - and one which I meant to just skim a few sample pages of, but ended up buying and then staying up the entire night to finish. I wasn\\'t even sure I wanted to write a review, because it seemed too difficult to put into words everything that moved me about this story and to try to do it justice.<br /><br />This ended up feeling like one of the best and most authentic romances I have read. In some ways, I feel conflicted like Anastasia when I say that: my instinct is to say that can\\'t be, because of what their relationship revolves around / how it\\'s constructed ... but somehow it can be and it\\'s true. Anastasia, Christian, and their relationship are all so honestly and openly written and shown to us that there is no other way for me to feel. Even though its counterintuitive, I can\\'t help but feel that their relationship is one of the most beautiful, complex, and emotional ones I\\'ve read in the romance genre.<br /><br />It\\'s one of those books that makes me want to go back to the last few 4-5 star books I read and knock down their ratings half a star, because when put on the same scale they don\\'t compare. I had a ridiculously foolish grin on my face throughout the entire thing, both because I was on one of those this-romance-is-unbelievably-fantastic highs and the book had some surprisingly good humor. I had a pleasant feeling of anticipation as I read, but I was also extremely nervous, because real BDSM sub/dom books are not my thing, and so while I was falling increasingly in love with Ana and Christian with every new page I read, I was also terrified that I was going to be jarringly yanked out of it all and the whole experience ruined for me by some kinky and needlessly over-the-top BDSM scene. Thankfully, that never happened, and it remained an amazing read right up until the very end.<br /><br /><b>{ Not What I Expected }</b><br />I\\'m not normally a BDSM book reader, but this was so, so, SO much more than just that. I don\\'t think that I have read one that is so beautifully and (seemingly) authentic. I write seemingly because I have no personal experience, so no idea, but to me it read that way. It was not done as a space apart in the book where the writer could insert random hot sex scenes. Instead, it\\'s woven throughout, showing us how it impacts and affects both characters. Ana and Christian remain Ana and Christian in those scenes, in the sense that it doesn\\'t feel like out-of-character gratuitous sex scenes are at every random turn just to satisfy some quota. I\\'m not even sure I want to categorize this book as erotica, because that seems so limiting. (There was hot - <u>intense</u> - chemistry, don\\'t get me wrong, and I definitely had some turn-the-AC-up moments).<br /><br /><b>{ Loved our Heroine: Anastasia / Ana (21) }</b><br />Anastasia was one of the best heroines, because she felt so real and her reactions each and every time were so normal! Not over-the-top for effect, but not understated because the author wants to be able to put lots of sex scenes. She\\'s a virgin, has no experience with men, and didn\\'t know anything about BDSM, so of course she\\'s going to be questioning this and unsure of whether it\\'s \"right\" or it\\'s \"wrong\" or if she even feels comfortable doing it. She also is very attracted - and eventually in love - with Christian and wants to be in a relationship with him. Ana feels a connection to him that she has never felt with any other person and she wants him in her life; he makes her happy. Her attempts to balance these two forces is wonderfully depicted and I could easily imagine myself reacting in those exact same ways, thinking those exact same things, and feeling those exact same conflicts.<br /><br />Ana is strong - she\\'s somewhat shy and quiet, but like all real people, you cannot fit her into only one category: she may seem reserved and quiet, but she can also stand up for herself and really knows her own mind - she is not the ideal sub Christian first thinks she might be. Ana examines her motivations and feelings when she\\'s confused or unsure - not only about what she <i>should</i> do, but about what she <i>wants</i> to do and what Christian wants from her. The story is told in first-person, which is sometimes iffy for me, but it worked well here; Ana\\'s tone as narrator is smart, self-aware, and immensely likable.<br /><br /><b>{ Adored our Hero: Christian (27) }</b><br />Christian is one of the best heroes. He\\'s intense and dark and I know some people still see him as mysterious and the dark force in all this, but I actually found him to be so accessible. There are still things we need to know about his history, obviously - I have some guesses, but don\\'t know anything for sure. Nonetheless, he also felt like the most authentic BDSM dom I could ever read because he\\'s not just that - he\\'s a man who has that part of himself incorporated into his life, personality, and mannerisms, so that it\\'s integral to his character, even when we see him around other characters who don\\'t know about this part of his life.<br /><br />Christian is possessive, a little stalkerish, domineering (no duh), authoritarian, elusive, mercurial - all of those things and more. He is also one of <i>the</i> most tender, tortured, and sensitive heroes I\\'ve ever read. His despair and his need for Ana is his life are like living, breathing things and they jump off the page. He also has a deep understanding about himself and his desires, though he discovers and faces new things through Ana\\'s questions and confrontations. He needs to dominate and control his partner, but he also needs Ana, so he is willing to compromise and not only tries to give her that \"more,\" but ends up wanting it himself as well.<br /><br /><b>{ An Unbelievable Connection and Relationship }</b><br />From the first page of their encounter, the chemistry between Anastasia and Christian was <b>off the charts</b>. It was one of the things that convinced me to buy the book after reading the sample - it was so intense. Their connection throughout feels so strong and despite the fact that they\\'re coming from such different places, you can see the constant back and forth of them trying to fit together, trying to understand what the other wants, what they themselves want, etc. The dialogue, <i>the emails</i>, the EVERYTHING between them is <b>\\n  <u>a m a z i n g</u>\\n</b> !!! I had such a ridiculous grin on my face for most the entire book. This goes back to my first point, but I was just so amazed by how <i>realistic</i> their relationship seemed, despite the BDSM sub/dom factor, which to me seems so foreign. It was complex, difficult, lovely, distressing, uplifting, intense, hopeful.<br /><br /><b>{ This Book Felt So Honest }</b><br />And I mean this in multiple ways: the main characters, their relationship, and the subject matter. Reading this book feels like an intimate act, because Ana and Christian are truly laid bare for us; yes, there are still things about his past we don\\'t know, but who they are, their essentials, are revealed to us. Their relationship is so honest, and I mean this in two ways: within the book and how the reader sees it. Within the book, I so, SO loved that they both try to be open with one another about their feelings and their doubts, that we see them trying to work through this relationship and feel each other out, figure out what this is between them. Loved, loved, LOVED it! Also, for the reader how their connection is shown, both in terms of man-woman and sub/dom felt very, very honest. It wasn\\'t porn-like or gratuitous or kinky for kink\\'s sake - it was built off of who these two people are and how they connect with and need one another.<br /><br /><b>{ Overall Fantastic }</b><br />Surprisingly funny and sweet! Fantastic secondary characters. No evil guy or superfluous subplot - the obstacles are within themselves and their relationship and that is more than enough; anything else would have ruined the book and taken away from their story. Subtle but sizzling chemistry and sexual tension. Complex characters. Etc, etc.<br /><br /><b>{ Ending of the Book / Series }</b> <i>(no spoilers)</i><br />*Important to know that Ana and Christian\\'s story does <u>not</u> end here.*<br />The ending is jarring, though I had ruined it for myself by having already read the next book\\'s summary (<i>\\n  <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11857408.Fifty_Shades_Darker__Fifty_Shades___2_\" title=\"Fifty Shades Darker (Fifty Shades, #2) by E.L. James\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fifty Shades Darker</a>\\n</i>, due out <u>September 15</u>). I think the buildup should definitely have been extended, because it did feel pretty out of the blue to me.<br /><br />As little a thing as it is, the fact that the end says \"End of Part One\" and this isn\\'t viewed as Book 1 and the next as Book 2, really made a difference to me. Gives more of a sense of continuity and makes this feel like an intermission. I love where the book / series titles come from, lol (Christian\\'s remark to Ana that he\\'s \"fifty shades of f*cked-up\"). Note: All together, there will be three books.<br /><br /><i>For those interested but unsure, Google has a relatively long sample section you can read to get a sense of whether you\\'ll like the book or not: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://books.google.com/ebooks?id=wR7_WVAHbJAC\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://books.google.com/ebooks?id=wR7...</a> </i><br /><br /><i>(Written August 17, 2011)</i><br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/199466200\" rel=\"nofollow\">\\n  <i>My review for Fifty Shades Darker</i>\\n</a></span>\\n  <a data-text-id=\"678395480298214939\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"swapContent($(this));; return false;\">...more</a>\\n\\n          </span>\\n        </div>\\n\\n\\n      <div class=\"reviewFooter uitext buttons\">\\n          \\n\\n<tr class=\"no_border feedFooterReview\" id=\"update_comment_stuff_Review196282417\">\\n  <td colspan=\"2\">\\n    <div class=\"updateActionLinks\">\\n        <a class=\"right flag\" rel=\"nofollow\" id=\"flag_link196282417\" title=\"Flag this review as inappropriate.\" href=\"/flagged/new?resource_id=196282417&amp;resource_type=Review&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F10818853-fifty-shades-of-grey\">flag</a>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      <span class=\\'likeItContainer\\' id=\\'like_container_review_196282417\\'><a id=\"like_count_review_196282417\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/rating/voters/196282417?resource_type=Review\"><span class=\"likesCount\">472 likes</span></a>&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"jsLike like_it gr-button gr-button--small\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/new?remember=true&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F10818853-fifty-shades-of-grey\">Like</a></span>\\n&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;<a href=\"/review/show/196282417?book_show_action=true&amp;from_review_page=1\">see review</a>\\n    </div>\\n\\n\\n    <div id=\\'comments_for_review_196282417\\' style=\\'display: none;\\'>\\n<div class=\\'brown_comment\\'>\\n<span class=\"loadingLinkSpan\"><a class=\"loadingLink\" data-remote=\"true\" href=\"/review/196282417/comments?reverse=true\">View all 468 comments</a><span class=\"loadingAnimation\"></span><span class=\"loadingError\"></span></span>\\n</div>\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n  </td>\\n</tr>\\n\\n      </div>\\n\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div class=\"clear\"></div>\\n</div>\\n\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n    <div class=\"elementListBrownSeparator\"></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n  <div class=\"friendReviews elementListBrown\" >\\n    <div class=\"section\">\\n      \\n\\n<div id=\"review_255547199\" class=\"review\" itemprop=\"reviews\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Review\">\\n  <link itemprop=\"url\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/255547199\" />\\n    <a title=\"Emily May\" class=\"left imgcol\" href=\"/user/show/4622890-emily-may\"><img alt=\"Emily May\" src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/users/1402215455p2/4622890.jpg\" /></a>\\n\\n  <div class=\"left bodycol\">\\n    <div class=\"reviewHeader uitext stacked\">\\n        <a class=\"reviewDate createdAt right\" href=\"/review/show/255547199?book_show_action=true\">Jan 03, 2012</a>\\n\\n      <span itemprop=\"author\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\">\\n        <a title=\"Emily May\" class=\"user\" itemprop=\"url\" name=\"Emily May\" href=\"/user/show/4622890-emily-may\">Emily May</a>\\n      </span>\\n\\n        rated it\\n        <span class=\" staticStars\"><span title=\"it was ok\" size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\">it was ok</span><span title=\"it was ok\" size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"></span><span title=\"it was ok\" size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p0\"></span><span title=\"it was ok\" size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p0\"></span><span title=\"it was ok\" size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p0\"></span></span>\\n\\n\\n\\n        \\n\\n\\n          <div class=\"uitext greyText bookshelves\">\\n            Shelves:\\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/4622890-emily-may?shelf=erotica\">erotica</a>, \\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/4622890-emily-may?shelf=romance\">romance</a>, \\n              <a class=\"actionLinkLite\" href=\"/review/list/4622890-emily-may?shelf=2012\">2012</a>\\n          </div>\\n    </div>\\n\\n\\n        <div class=\"reviewText stacked\">\\n              <span id=\"reviewTextContainer255547199\" class=\"readable\"\\n              >\\n            \\n<span id=\"freeTextContainer15537215502916382020\"><br>I have finally made a decision about <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10818853.Fifty_Shades_of_Grey__Fifty_Shades___1_\" title=\"Fifty Shades of Grey (Fifty Shades, #1) by E.L.

But I\\'ve spent quite a long time thinking about this novel, the characters, and the relationship portrayed. I\\'ve been thinking about all the reasons people hate this so much and love it so much. I need to confess - for those who missed it - that I originally reviewed this first book immediately after finishing it and before I started (and finished) the other two books in the trilogy. I gave it three stars, I expressed all that <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10818853.Fifty_Shades_of_Grey__Fifty_Shades___1_\" title=\"Fifty Shades of Grey (Fifty Shades, #1) by E.L. James\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fifty Shades of Grey</a> had made me feel: annoyed, frustrated, confused, and also entertained. I have since then felt like I have much more to add.<br><br>The reason I personally think that opinions differ so greatly on these novels is not because people have different sexual tastes. For some, yeah, this will come into play. However, I think the main reason is that this book and the characters send out a confusing mix of messages. When I finished <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10818853.Fifty_Shades_of_Grey__Fifty_Shades___1_\" title=\"Fifty Shades of Grey (Fifty Shades, #1) by E.L. James\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fifty Shades of Grey</a>, I had no idea what kind of book I\\'d just read. Was it BDSM erotica? Or the tale of a man\\'s childhood abuse and how this impacted on his sex life later on? Were Christian Grey\\'s sexual tastes supposed to be erotic or wrong? Let me tell those of you who haven\\'t read this: it isn\\'t clear.<br><br>This book appears to be an erotic BDSM romance at face value. But Ana makes it clear early on that she doesn\\'t want that kind of relationship, that Christian is \"fifty shades of fucked up\", that the way he behaves isn\\'t right, but is actually the result of an abusive upbringing. Ana later contradicts her early decision and gets all pouty when Christian won\\'t play kinky with her... and yet the previous time he\\'d done it she spent the evening crying and feeling sorry for herself. Some people seem to see Christian as the big bad man who abuses a weak young woman. This is not the case. There is nothing, I repeat <i>nothing</i>, that happens between the two of them that Ana doesn\\'t give consent to. Sure, she may whine about it afterwards, or use the excuse that she doesn\\'t want to lose him, but she makes the choices, she holds the power.<br><br>Here\\'s what I think is the ultimate problem with <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10818853.Fifty_Shades_of_Grey__Fifty_Shades___1_\" title=\"Fifty Shades of Grey (Fifty Shades, #1) by E.L. James\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fifty Shades of Grey</a>: Ms James\\' terrible writing. It\\'s nothing new, she even admitted it herself, but that is why we all can\\'t figure out what it is about this book that makes it some parts entertaining, some parts annoying as fuck. Because I\\'m trying to categorise this so I can begin to understand it, so that I can form my opinion and write my review accordingly. But we cannot understand what doesn\\'t make sense. And James\\' characterisation does not make any sense at all. She writes Ana as a naive student at the mercy of Christian\\'s abusive past, then she writes Ana as a sexual manipulator who actually likes BDSM. Is Christian sexy or a victim? I\\'ll tell you: he\\'s both and neither, because James cannot create characters and relationships to save her life. She contradicts herself, she changes her mind without logical reason. This is why it is pointless analysing the relationship between Ana and Christian. One minute it\\'s sexy, the next minute it\\'s fucked up. One minute it\\'s BDSM, the next minute it\\'s abuse. How do you accurately review a book that changes its mind every two minutes?<br><br>I also feel I need to say something about BDSM. Any more than a small amount of kinky doesn\\'t really interest me, but it doesn\\'t bother me either if it is between consenting adults. However, there are two things I can say about this matter in <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10818853.Fifty_Shades_of_Grey__Fifty_Shades___1_\" title=\"Fifty Shades of Grey (Fifty Shades, #1) by E.L. James\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fifty Shades of Grey</a>: 1) it really isn\\'t <i>that</i> kinky, and 2) for the most part, this isn\\'t really a BDSM relationship (I don\\'t think the author actually understands what one is). I can\\'t say that I\\'m experienced in visiting <i>those kind</i> of clubs down the dark allies of Soho, but I\\'ve done not a small amount of reading on the psychological aspect of BDSM relationships. I have a keen interest in feminism and I have often wondered if something like this is nothing but a hindrance to the progress of women and equality. I would conclude from my reading that it is not. <br><br>Firstly, BDSM relationships are about give and take. The dom and the sub each give one another what they want/need. It isn\\'t about abuse, it isn\\'t about selfishly taking what you want, and because these relationships involve relinquishing control to another person, there is a deep amount of trust required. Also, it is important to note that the power of the dom is an illusion, the sub holds all the power, they say how far it goes, when it stops, what is too much. The key thing is that <b>both of them get something out of it</b>. Which is why the relationship in <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10818853.Fifty_Shades_of_Grey__Fifty_Shades___1_\" title=\"Fifty Shades of Grey (Fifty Shades, #1) by E.L. James\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fifty Shades of Grey</a> can only be called BDSM when Ana does an abrupt u-turn on her opinions and decides she wants a bit of spankiness. The parts where she is upset about the relationship Christian wants - that is not BDSM. The parts where she reluctantly allows him to get his way - that is not BDSM. <br><br>I think there is nothing wrong with BDSM erotica. I think there is nothing wrong with doms, subs, sex slaves, whatever... if that is what the person wants.

Just Wow!!</b><br /><br />This book is <b>5+ stars for me!!</b> It is my favorite kind of story. You know what I mean...just so intense that the characters get so far under your skin that you can\\'t stand to be away from them for any length of time? Well, that was me while reading this book, I couldn\\'t concentrate to get anything done :)<br /><br />There are a lot of reviews on this book, and obviously the majority love it, so I am simply going to explain some of the reasons that this story grabbed hold of my heart and wouldn\\'t let go.<br /><br />First, I am a total sucker for the tortured hero and you would be hard pressed to find a hero more tortured that our own beloved Christian Grey. That said, the fact that he is a gazillionaire at age 27 is nothing to shake a stick at! Christian\\'s intensity and focus is what really captured me in all this, I keep having to remind myself how old he is. The chemistry between Anastasia &amp; Christian is just off the friggin\\' charts, I swear at times I could feel it coming right off the pages, from the moment she \\'fell\\' into his office!! :)<br /><br />I really enjoyed the BDSM element, it wasn\\'t necessarily heavy but intense, especially listening to Christian tell Ana that he WANTED to hurt her and why. When he said he had never had to explain it before and knew he wasn\\'t explaining well just melted my heart. There is such a vulnerable, sweet boy underneath that gorgeous domineering man!<br /><br />Obviously you can tell I am completely smitten with Christian, but let me tell you a little bit about why I completely love Ana too. Even though she is an innocent, oh and I mean really innocent, I can\\'t help but love her fire! Yes, just like the rest of the female population she has fallen completely under Christian\\'s spell but she is not willing to just submit to his every whim - She\\'s feisty but conflicted, I love the emotion!! <br /><br />Now, I could wax poetic about this book all day long but I will instead say if you haven\\'t read this and you enjoy a read that will stay with you for days after you finish it then I cannot recommend this enough!! <b>GO GET IT - RIGHT NOW!!!</b> That\\'s right, shouty capitals!! LOL - I myself finished this one and jumped right into <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11857408.Fifty_Shades_Darker__Fifty_Shades___2_\" title=\"Fifty Shades Darker (Fifty Shades, #2) by E.L.

I have never suffered so much in my life. This book has absolutely no redeeming qualities. Normally I’d add a short summary of the plot, but there is no fucking plot. Boy meets girl, boy is a fucking psychopath, girl does as she’s told, lots of sex, lots of whining. The parts that didn’t have sex bored me out of my goddamn mind, and the parts that did have sex were so absurd and revolting that I couldn’t go on reading without raging on Goodreads about it.<br><br>I seriously cannot wrap my head around the fact that this is a bestseller. That women all over the world adore this book, and adore Christian Grey. The man is an abusive stalker and the fact that women are fantasising about this fuckwit sets our society back about 500 years. Thanks for that, wankers.<br><br><b>Reasons why you should run away from Christian Grey and possibly shoot and castrate him</b><br><br>Oh boy, where do I start?<br><br><a href=\"http://tinypic.com?ref=2419lc6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">\\n  <img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1408298666ra/10833330.gif\" alt=\"Image and video hosting by TinyPic\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"></a><br><br>* He tracks her fucking phone. Strike one.<br><blockquote>\\n<i>\"How did you find me?\"<br><br>\"I tracked your cell phone Anastasia.\"<br><br>Oh, of course he did. How is that possible? Is that legal? </i>Stalker<i>, my subconscious whispers at me through the cloud of tequila that\\'s still floating in my brain, but somehow, because it\\'s him, I don\\'t mind.</i>\\n</blockquote><br>Because it’s not stalking if the guy is hot!<br><br>* <i>“Well, if you were mine, you wouldn’t be able to sit down for a week after the stunt you pulled yesterday.”</i> Strike two.<br><br>* <i>“You should steer clear from me.”</i> Strike three, and he should be out. Go home, thank you for playing.<br><br>But the list goes on.<br><br>* Christian’s endless commanding and controlling Anastasia. “Sit.” “Come.” “Eat.” Like she’s a fucking dog. Worst of all, Anastasia would happily wag her tail and roll over for him.<br><br>* More stalker tendencies: he knows where she lives without her telling him. When Kate and Ana move house to Seattle, he <i>again</i> knows where she lives without her telling him. And then, when Ana flies to Georgia to <i>escape</i>, not only does he know where her mother lives, he also knows her mother’s last name, knows which flight Ana is on, and <i>follows her to Georgia</i>. Without her permission. And he happens to stay in the hotel she’s having dinner at. Fucking hell. If that’s not an alarm bell, I don’t know what is. This guy is fucking insane.<br><br>* Bipolar tendencies. One moment, he’s all nice, the next, he becomes dark and cold. Just the mere <i>mention</i> of another guy gets him angry. He becomes all moody when there’s another male presence around Ana. It’s sickening.<br><br>* He gets a thrill out of how young Ana looks with pigtails.<br><br>* Not only does he tell her when to eat, he also orders her drinks and food for her, without taking into account what she wants.<br><blockquote>\\n  <i>“Is this what our err… relationship will be like?” I whisper. “You, ordering me around?”<br><br>“Yes,” he murmurs.</i>\\n</blockquote><br>The BDSM contract is the perfect example of this:<br><blockquote>\\n  <i>“The Submissive will ensure she achieves a minimum of seven hours sleep a night when she is not with the Dominant.”<br><br>“The Submissive will not snack between meals, with the exception of fruit.”<br><br>“During the term, the Submissive will wear clothing only approved by the Dominant.”<br><br>“The Dominant shall provide the Submissive with a personal trainer four times a week in hour-long sessions.”<br><br>\"The Submissive shall accept whippings, floggings, spankings, caning, paddling or any other discipline the Dominant should decide to administer, without hesitation, enquiry or complaint.”<br><br>“The Submissive shall not touch or pleasure herself sexually without permission from the Dominant.”<br><br>“The Submissive shall submit to any sexual activity demanded by the Dominant and shall do without hesitation or argument.”<br><br>“The Submissive shall not look directly into the eyes of the Dominant except when specifically instructed to do so.”</i>\\n</blockquote><br>Not only that, but you will undergo any beauty treatment I tell you, wax whenever and wherever I tell you, and be available every weekend. I really hope I don’t need to explain how sick this is.<br><br>* The guy is an absolute control freak. <br><blockquote>\\n  <i> \"You\\'ve not eaten very much.\"<br><br>\"I\\'ve had enough.\" <br><br>“Three oysters, four bites of cod, and one asparagus stalk, no potatoes, no nuts, no olives, and you’ve not eaten all day.”</i>\\n</blockquote><br>He’s keeping a fucking inventory of the things she eats. He also keeps track of how many orgasms he’s given her. And he gets angry when Ana decides to go away for a bit, even if it’s just to visit her mother. <i>“Palm-twitchingly mad.”</i><br><br>* He doesn’t give two shits about what Ana wants. Ana has mentioned a dozen times about how she doesn’t want Christian to buy her things. So he buys her 14,000-dollar-worth old books, a Macbook, a Blackberry, and a fucking car.<br><br>* He’s obviously a creep. He gives her grades like she’s a bloody school girl. Worst of all – she’s proud of it too.<br><blockquote>\\n  <i>“Swallowing semen… well, you get an A in that.”<br><br>I flush, and my inner goddess smacks her lips together with glowing pride.</i>\\n</blockquote><br><a href=\"http://tinypic.com?ref=148lqvd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">\\n  <img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1408298666ra/10833331.gif\" alt=\"Image and video hosting by TinyPic\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"></a><br><br>Just.. yikes.<br><br>He also says he’d “pay good money” to see her consult with a gynaecologist. What the fuck is wrong with you?!<br><br>And he has rape tendencies:<br><blockquote>\\n  <i>“No one’s ever said no to me before. And it’s so – hot.”</i>\\n</blockquote><br>* He doesn’t like it when she asks personal questions, yet has no qualms with invading her privacy three times over.<br><br>* He wants to own Ana. He wants her to be his possession. Like she’s a fucking car.<br><br><b>Even more alarm bells:</b><br>1.\\t<i>“You scare me when you’re angry.”</i><br><br>2.\\tHe spanks her so hard that she can’t sit down from the pain. <i>“Holy fuck it hurts.”</i><br><br>3.\\tAbout the spanking: <i>“During the whole alarming process I felt demeaned, debased and abused.”</i><br><br>4.\\tTo which he replies: <i>“I am tempted to drive back over there to ensure that you don’t sit down for a week, rather than an evening.”</i><br><br>5.\\tAna never cries, until she meets Christian. Suddenly, she cries all the time.<br><br>6.\\t<i>“Take some Advil – this is not a request. And don’t drive your Beetle. I will know.”</i><br><br>7.\\t<i>“If I listened to my body, I’d be in Alaska by now.”<br><br>“Alaska is very cold and no place to run. <b>I would find you. I can track your cell phone – remember?</b>”</i><br><br>8.\\t<i>“Will he ever give me a break? He is suffocating me.”</i><br><br>9.\\t<i>“He’d probably like to beat seven shades of shit out of me.”</i><br><br>10.\\t<i>“Holy cow. He wants to hurt me… how do I deal with this? I can’t hide the horror on my face.”</i><br><br><a href=\"http://tinypic.com?ref=2vshzx4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">\\n  <img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1408298666i/10833332.jpg\" alt=\"Image and video hosting by TinyPic\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"></a><br><br>Right, I think there are enough examples here. This is beyond fucked up.<br><br><b>On to the writing.</b> It was <i>horrible</i>. Every single word was overused. I am going to shoot someone if I ever have to hear “oh my” or “holy cow” again. If I have to read one more mention about how she bites her lip, or how s/he gasps, or how their breaths hitch.

When we all know she’s a dumb cunt, because she signs contracts without reading them. The fact that she keeps running back to Christian also signifies that she has an IQ of a garden gnome.<br><br>There was also the constant need to remind us that Christian Grey is good-looking. Seriously, every time she saw him there was mention of how hot he was, and every time she thought of him, as well. “Adonis”, “Michelangelo’s David has nothing on him”, someone pass me a bucket.<br><br>Then there are the <b>inaccuracies</b>. Anastasia has to be some kind of Superwoman. No hangover after drinking tequila for the first time. She’s never been drunk in her life, yet she can wolf down a massive breakfast easily the next morning. Then, when her virginity is absolutely destroyed by Christian (literally – <i>“he slams into me” / “as he rips through my virginity”</i>), she comes twice and is happy to do it again right away. She has no pain whatsoever. She’s also perfectly able to take it doggy style after just losing her virginity, because why the fuck not.<br><br>On top of that, she\\'s instantly exceptional at everything. Must be great, to be a natural. No awkwardness whatsoever.<br><br>At one point, she gasps and swallows at the same time. I tried to do it. I don’t think it’s possible.<br><br><b>Things that I think were supposed to be sexy but really weren’t</b><br><br><i>“The walls and ceiling are a deep, dark burgundy, giving a <b>womb-like effect</b> to the spacious room.”<br><br><a href=\"http://tinypic.com?ref=1zmdsbc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1408298666i/10833335.jpg\" alt=\"Image and video hosting by TinyPic\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"></a><br><br>“Two orgasms… coming apart at the seams, like the spin cycle on a washing machine, wow.”<br><br>“He slowly inserts his thumb inside me, rotating it round and round, stroking the front wall of my vagina.”</i> After which he sticks his bloody thumb in her mouth.<br><br><i>“I pull him deeper into my mouth so I can feel him at the back of my throat and then to the front again. My tongue swirls around the end. <b>He’s my very own Christian Grey flavour popsicle</b>.”</i> Not only is that disgusting, but I find it hard to believe that she thinks giving blowjobs is a turn-on. I find nothing sexy about testing my gag reflex repeatedly.<br><br>As if Christian read my mind, he goes, <i>“Don’t you have a gag reflex?”</i> Words every girl wants to hear.<br><br><i>“My heated blood pools low in my belly.”</i> Is she on her period?<br><br><i>“Stop biting your lip, or I will fuck you in the elevator, and I don’t care who gets in with us.”</i> Whoa there, cowboy.<br><br><i>“I’d really like to claim your ass, Anastasia.”</i> What, you’re going to put a flag up there?<br><br>The tampon scene.<br><br><a href=\"http://tinypic.com?ref=f40nr8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">\\n  <img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1408298666ra/10833336.gif\" alt=\"Image and video hosting by TinyPic\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"></a><br><br><b>Things I learned from Fifty Shades of Grey:</b><br><br>* If your future mother-in-law practically catches you having sex with her son, don’t worry – she’ll be delighted to meet you, because it means her son is not gay.<br><br>* Find someone who’s willing to be your Dominant. That way, you never have to make any decisions again! He’ll decide what and when you eat and drink, when and how long you sleep, what you wear, what you drive, when you exercise… easy!<br><br>* Your first time will not be painful, even if you’ve never masturbated before. Not even if he slams into you! You won’t feel a thing. In fact, you’ll like it and you’ll come twice. Then you’ll want to do it again straight away!<br><br>* You look plain. That’s okay.

The writing left a lot to be desired, the heroine didn\\'t impress me at <i>all</i> and yet I find myself wanting to read the next in the series. <br /><br />After having a day to let this sink in I have to try and put my feelings succinctly into a review. How do I say this exactly......... Anastasia damn near killed me. There were just too many things about her that turned me off bigtime. I can understand how her vulnerability could make you warm to her, but it just made me frustrated more than anything.<br /><br />The attraction between Christian and Ana was intoxicating and I was invested in it for sure, but the way that Ana was written really let her down in my opinion. She was an innocent young woman with no sexual experience but her immaturity and childish demeanor really astounded me. At 21 surely she would have had a bit more understanding of the way the world works. The whole \"inner goddess vs subconscious\" thing was so ridiculous and referred to so many times that I literally wanted to beat my head open with my e-reader. And also - pigtails. PIGTAILS on a 21 year old are <i>so</i> not okay. I\\'m sorry but what??<br /><br />Her completely contradictory behaviour - wide eyed innocence and being totally petrified by Christian\\'s sexual tastes but thinking it\\'s hot at the same time. I validate her reasoning behind being nervous about it but honestly why go through with it? If that\\'s the only way you\\'re going to be able to have Christian - by signing up for something like that - then do it. But don\\'t carry on about it for the entire book. You\\'re either invested in him and the relationship or not at all. I\\'m sorry but I\\'m a realist. <br /><br />Another example of Ana\\'s immaturity and contradictory behaviour is how she got so angry at Kate for trying to rile Christian up and stoke his jealousy but then Ana did the exact same thing herself on the <i>next page</i> when she got the massage in first class and told him all about it. The game playing did not warm me to her whatsoever. <br /><br />In my status updates and other comments I stated how I felt the writing was awful. I really did, at least in the first half. The first person POV didn\\'t help matters either; the narrative was so stilted and had no flow. It read like, \"I did this and then this happened and I walked here and I made my bed\". The lack of structure was amateurish and painful and made me wonder if the book had been edited at all. <br /><br />So now that I\\'ve got that off my chest let\\'s talk about what I did like. A gorgeous multi-millionaire that becomes almost obsessed with you and wants to keep you for his very own? Any girl\\'s ultimate fantasy right? That aspect of this story is what got me hooked. The fact that Christian had a particular method and structure with his relationships also really drew me in. A dominant hero who finds himself in lust (and maybe even in love) with an innocent is quite fascinating to me and kept me reading. <a class=\"jsShowSpoiler spoilerAction\">(view spoiler)</a><span class=\"spoilerContainer\" style=\"display: none\">[The BDSM didn\\'t bother me at all perhaps until the very end when the shit hit the fan. <a class=\"jsHideSpoiler spoilerAction\">(hide spoiler)</a>]</span><br /><br />And then miracle of miracles, Ana actually grew on me towards the latter part of the book. I found myself very emotionally involved especially in the last 30 or so pages and it was interesting the way the chips fell. That is why I intend to read the next book in the series where no doubt I will be huffing and puffing about Ana all over again. <br /><br /><b>As an update.....</b> I can\\'t believe my review is getting so many likes 9 months after reading this book. I thought I should let y\\'all know that I haven\\'t touched this trilogy since stumbling my way through this way back then.</span>\\n  <a data-text-id=\"1785642799483378179\" href=\"#\"

(I also got a free copy of the book, no way was I going to pay for this.) And while I now have a better understanding of the fascination, I still don’t get it. Sure, there were some hot sex scenes, and at times Grey and Ana were both likable characters. I eventually even understood their fascination with each other. And I liked them when they were away from the whole BDSM/punishment/discipline/control freaky shit. Grey even had the sexual stamina of ten horny rabbits put together! What’s not to like about that? (Dang, that man is always hard and ready!!) <br><br>But so much of this book was utterly disturbing! It primarily focused on Grey trying to coerce and manipulate her into being what HE needed, despite how much it would hurt her. He claimed to care for her and was patient, but it always boiled down to his need to punish and inflict pain. Outwardly he came across as a suave, polished and sophisticated normal person, but inwardly he was one sick dude. There were times they really were a great couple, but only when they were in a ‘normal’ environment. When the BDSM environment was involved, I wasn’t a fan of either of them. <br><br>Initially I couldn’t understand what the heck Grey saw in Ana. A clumsy, mousy naïve girl who face plants on the ground (TWICE!), and then pukes her drunken gut out. <i> (Uh right, what guy wouldn\\'t get hot for a girl like that?) </i> His quick attachment to her had me baffled for nearly the first half of the book. If all he wanted was a submissive with no romantic ties, why chose her? By his own words he no problem finding consenting partners before. <br><br>After Grey reveals his proclivities, I figured Ana would run for the hills if she had a brain in her head. Unfortunately, she is a naïve virgin with no experience to even compare him to, and the poor girl is so blinded by how “OMG, he’s so HOT!” So when she actually entertains his twisted notions and begins negotiating terms of hard and soft limits, I wanted to scream at her! How stupid and naïve are you girl?!! WTF?? WHY?? She was too trusting, too unaware, and he was painting one rosy ass picture of how wonderful his lifestyle would be for her. Sorry, but signing over your free will into a sexual contract where you WILL get hurt is just F’d up, especially when your gut feelings are constantly telling you to flee. <br><br>I’ll give Grey bonus points for his honesty at being so upfront with Ana, but that doesn’t make what he is about any less of a predator. He was honest with her about not wanting a normal ‘hearts and flowers’ relationship. If she agreed, she would be his submissive and enter into TRAINING. All he has to do is brainwash her into believing she would actually prefer this life style over the normal one she dreamed of. (WTF??!) <br><br>Another aspect I did not get was how Ana repeatedly accuses him of having commitment issues, but throughout the book it was her that had one foot in the relationship and the other foot well outside of the door. He on the hand was far more committed, albeit with a strict set of ‘rules’. <br><br>Despite all the WTFery and the disturbing portrayal of a young woman being coerced into an unknown and unsafe world, I was fascinated with the overall story. Like watching a train wreck fascinated, and nothing to be proud of. I found myself wanting to read just one more chapter and then another. So yes, this book was hard to put down. It was also hard not to pitch it at the wall! <br><br>I honestly thought I would not want to read about BDSM, but surprisingly that aspect didn\\'t even bother me all that much until the end <a class=\"jsShowSpoiler spoilerAction\">(view spoiler)</a><span class=\"spoilerContainer\" style=\"display: none\">[The hard spanking scene was just cruel, as intended, and beyond disturbing!! <a class=\"jsHideSpoiler spoilerAction\">(hide spoiler)</a>]</span>. If this was about two mutual consenting adults who fully understood what they were getting into, I might have even enjoyed it. But the constant coercion and manipulation killed the book for me. <br><br><b>In the end this book really made me want to scrub myself clean with Christian\\'s own go-to cure for all those bruising sore asses. (Oh, lovely!) Take some Advil. And rub on some Arnica cream to sooth ‘bruising, sprains and injuries’. </b><br><img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1391046327i/8322937.jpg\" width=\"170\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"><img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1380375667i/730298.jpg\" width=\"150\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"><br><br>The writing is another issue with this book. It wasn’t nearly as bad as I feared, but the euphemistic inner dialogue drove me nuts. The book often read like a comic book script, not a serious contemporary novel. All of the <i>Oh, my! GASP! whoa! What?! Kabam! Pow Pow! </i>(OK, not the last couple ones, but the rest are real!) were tiresome and over-done to death. <br><br>Well…love it or hate it, this was one controversial and thought provoking book, just WAY too distributing for my personal taste. They say one man\\'s trash is another man\\'s treasure, and maybe in this case one woman\\'s trashy mommy porn is another woman\\'s hot treasured erotica.

As many of you may know, the publishing house Vintage recently purchased the erotic romance series 50 Shades of Grey, written by E.L. James, for a seven figure sum, thus allowing her to benefit from the Chancellor\\'s recent top rate tax cut. I\\'m sure he\\'ll be delighted to take responsibility for that.<br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1380238789ra/681624.gif\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"><br><br>This book, originally published online as Twilight fan-fiction, has angered many in the literary community, especially those who feel that the author exploited fandom and copyrighted material for her own personal gain. The people are angry, Mr Speaker, and since this complacent government won\\'t take it upon themselves to listen to the will of the people, not the corporations, I decided to read the book myself to see what all the fuss was about. It was... enlightening.<br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1380238789ra/681625.gif\" alt=\"Ed suddenly remembers he is supposed to taking this all very seriously.&lt;br /&gt;PMQs 29/02/2012\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"><br><br>First of all, it\\'s heinously written. It makes the NHS bill look like a Booker prize winner. I can\\'t help but wonder if the author was being paid by the ellipses. The British author just cannot write authentic American dialogue to save herself. It doesn\\'t matter how many times the heroine gets called \\'baby\\', that won\\'t hide the frequent British anachronisms that any half-decent editor could have fixed. I won\\'t even get started on the cringe-worthy nature of the dialogue itself. These characters read like teenagers, or at least how a middle aged woman imagines teenagers speak, which is worrying given they\\'re all supposed to be in their twenties, but not surprising given that this is Twilight fan-fiction. A brief side note for the less internet savvy Members of Parliament present today. Fan-fiction are stories written by fans of an original work. Sometimes they\\'re based on movies, songs, or in this instances books. And sometimes they\\'re based on real people, known as RPF. During my research I uncovered a significant amount of RPF relating to me and various people of political interest. What can I say? What has been seen cannot be unseen:<br><br><img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1380238789i/681626.jpg\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"><br><br>Returning back to the matter in hand, the juvenile nature of the prose only serves to highlight just how ridiculous the content of the novel is. The characters are clearly Edward and Bella (don\\'t ask me how I know this, I\\'m a Desperate Housewives fan so my taste in popular culture is suspect at best) with no editing or creative spin put on them to differentiate them from fan-fiction state to original fiction state. They\\'re bland, predictable and entirely stupid. Mr Speaker, the so-called hero of this piece, Christian Grey, is nothing short of an abusive spouse, masquerading as a sexual dominant. He pushes Ana into a situation she has no real understanding of and never provides her with any real information on what she\\'s been forced into. Once again, we\\'re left with a nasty little man considered charming and desirable based solely on his looks, although I imagine his extreme wealth also has something to do with that. He\\'s condescending, mean, classless, he stalks her and puts her in situations she clearly says she\\'s uncomfortable with. How is it romantic or sexy to intimidate your girlfriend and have her constantly worry about upsetting you for fear of your twitchy palm? That\\'s shocking, Mr Speaker! Shocking!<br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1380222758ra/266874.gif\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"><br><br>The hastily developed romance is not romance and it\\'s more embarrassingly hilarious than sexy. This author has absolutely no understanding of what a dominant/submissive relationship entails. Christian\\'s abhorrent behaviour is excused as a normal part of BDSM and D/S relations, which stem from his childhood trauma. Because, of course, only messed up people would ever want to mix pain with pleasure. This cheap, lazy mis-characterisation of an issue the author clearly knows less about than her readers only does a disservice to romance readers, real D/S relationships, and women full stop. It\\'s bad enough that our society is sex obsessed without ever really discussing it, but surely women deserve better porn than this? I know my shadow Chancellor agrees with me. <br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1380222758ra/265428.gif\" alt=\"I hear that over the christmas break, the two Eds have been perfecting their rhymes for their Rap Duo outfit ready to bust the PMQs scene this wednesday. \\xa0Ed M is spitting his flow while Ed B appreciates the rhythm with his all out intense head bob. \\xa0Gets even the most dormant of back benches moving.\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"><br><br>It\\'s not even that kinky! It\\'s a sad sign of just how sexually conservative this world is when a little spanking is considered hardcore BDSM. Then again, the spanking in this book is rage inducing in how badly it gets D/S relations wrong. Threatening the heroine is not how it works! At one point in the novel, Christian says, and I quote, \"I could threaten you.\" Mr Speaker, how is this acceptable? The author doesn\\'t know what she\\'s doing! The only time this could legitimately enters the realm of kink is when Christian yanks out Ana\\'s tampon and proceeds to have sex with her while she\\'s menstruating. Not my cup of tea, I must admit. However, the scene is so badly written, so immature in its 1st person narration of the scene from Ana\\'s point of view, that the only natural reaction is to laugh, cry or enter a perpetual state of panda-faced bemusement: <br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1380222758ra/488259.gif\" alt=\"PMQs Wednesday 80/06/2011\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"><br><br>Now, I won\\'t go into further details on that area here in the interests of parliamentary politeness, but rest assured that many more qualified people than I have discussed this matter at length. Maybe the Chancellor can help us out there again, yes? <br><br><img width=\"350\" src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1380238789i/681627.jpg\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"><br><br>Lashed to the mast, yes, Mr Chancellor? <br><br>Mr Speaker, nothing in this book rings true. It\\'s lacking in tension, in strong characterisation, in decent prose, in readable dialogue, in consistency and in pacing. It\\'s evident that this work is fan-fiction because it reads like fan-fiction, not only in content but in style. It reads like it was supposed to be read on a chapter-by-chapter basis the way fan-fiction is designed. There\\'s no finesse to the text. I highly doubt its publishers, The Writer\\'s Coffee Shop, bothered to properly edit it before churning out overpriced copies to be sold online. A simple search-and-replace on names seems to have been the maximum work done to the text, as evidenced by Dear Author\\'s comparison between the book and the original fan-fiction, available on their site. Mr Speaker, I can\\'t help but feel exasperated by this self satisfied smug complacency by James and TWCS.<br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1380222758ra/266873.gif\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"><br><br>It\\'s not hard to see why readers are angry. Not only because of the more than suspect background to the story\\'s origins and subsequent publication as well as the author\\'s own behaviour. Not only because of the 7 figure publishing deal, the placement on the New York Times Bestseller list, and the rumours of a movie adaptation, something that could rival The Room in terms of midnight showing hilarity. Not only because of the mainstream media\\'s complete lack of understanding on issues of fandom, romance novels, erotica and women\\'s sexuality. Not only all of that, Mr Speaker. Readers have the right to be angry because this book is just plain bad. There is so much wrong with this book that just one Miliband cannot express it:<br><br><img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1380238789i/681628.jpg\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"><br><br>Mr Speaker, action must be taken, and I doubt it will come from this complacent Prime Minister. We need strong, informed and occasionally sarcastic action against this surge of pull-to-publish fan-fiction that threatens to fill the market. If not, we will find that we have dug ourselves into a hole that will be impossible to escape, as demonstrated by my shadow Chancellor:<br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1380238789ra/681629.gif\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"><br><br>A hole where creative copyright is diluted time and time again for profit, bypassing the copyright laws the way the cabinet evades the tax laws, never technically illegal but still morally suspect. Mr Speaker, where will it end? 50 Shades of Grey fan-fiction already exists - surely the Inception of fan-fiction - and what\\'s to stop someone from taking that, changing the names and submitting it to TWCS or Omnific for publication? The media\\'s lack of understanding of fandom can only hinder the discussions we truly need on this matter, so let us demand them and let us demand action!<br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1380238789ra/681630.gif\" alt=\"anotherlgbtchat:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;fuckyeahpmqs:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PMQs… NOW… GET TO IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad my GIFs are being put to good use!\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"><br><br>But the question is, will anything ever truly be done? Mr Speaker, I am sad to say that I doubt it will. Profit before creativity, money before ideas. The same old story from the same old Tories... I mean industry. Same difference. We await further developments of this case eagerly. Now, this is the first book in a trilogy, one that ends on a highly predictable cliffhanger, and I\\'ve been asked if I will read the other two. My answer is a short one:<br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1380238789ra/681631.gif\" alt=\"Erm… no.&lt;br /&gt;Wednesday 09/11/2011\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"><br><br>Mr Speaker I yield the floor.

Just when she is starting to figure it out with him, her world is tilted once again with a phone call from none other than Ramsey Bridges. A year after his entrance into her life, Ramsey is trying to make amends and does the one thing she never expects—invites her to Jack\\\\\\'s wedding.\\\\n\\\\nThe wedding she had evaded at all costs. But no matter what she does, Lexi can\\\\\\'t seem to escape her past with Jack. But does she really want to?\\\\n\\\\nDespite the explosive chemistry between Lexi and Ramsey, she is skeptical about trusting him after everything that has happened. When things are amiss with him, she starts questioning his motives.

Orphaned at an early age, she had a rough childhood and a boyfriend who was murdered. Now the beautiful, stylish Lexie is determined to change her luck and her life. But first she\\\\\\'s got to make good on a promise: to pick up Ty Walker from prison. One look at the gorgeous ex-convict and Lexie knows she\\\\\\'s in trouble-and already thinking about taking a walk on the wild side . . . \\\\n\\\\nFor five years, Ty was imprisoned for a crime he didn\\\\\\'t commit. Now he wants revenge on the people who framed him. Yet when the high-stakes poker player sees the leggy Lexie, he suddenly has other desires on his mind.

Could it?\\\\n\\\\nCandace Andrews has had enough of pleasing others. In an act of birthday rebellion, she sets out to please herself—by walking into the tattoo parlor owned by her cousin’s ex-boyfriend. All she wants is a little ink, and Brian’s just the guy to give it to her.\\\\n\\\\nAs soon as she submits to his masterful hands, though, the forbidden attraction she’s always felt for him resurfaces…and she realizes the devilishly sexy artist could give her so much more.\\\\n\\\\nSweet, innocent Candace is the last person Brian expected to see again. She’s everything he’s not, and her family despises him. He doesn’t need the hassle, but he needs her, and this time no one is taking her away. Not even those who threaten to make his life a living hell.\\\\n\\\\nBacked into a corner, Candace faces the worst kind of choice. Cave in to those who think Brian is a living nightmare…or hold her ground and risk it all for the one man who rocks her world.\\\\n\\\\nWarning: This book contains explicit sex, naughty language, tattoos aplenty, family drama, a hot rock concert…and a bad boy hero who’s pierced in all the right places.<\\\\/span>\\\\n  <a data-text-id=\\\\\"17794141142669246301\\\\\" href=\\\\\"#\\\\\" onclick=\\\\\"swapContent($(this));; return false;\\\\\">...more<\\\\/a>\\\\n\\\\n    <\\\\/div>\\\\n\\\\n      <div class=\\\\\\'wtrButtonContainer wtrSignedOut\\\\\\' id=\\\\\\'12_book_8135807\\\\\\'>\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'wtrUp wtrLeft\\\\\\'>\\\\n<form action=\\\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\\\" accept-charset=\\\\\"UTF-8\\\\\" method=\\\\\"post\\\\\"><input name=\\\\\"utf8\\\\\" type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" value=\\\\\"&#x2713;\\\\\" /><input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"authenticity_token\\\\\" value=\\\\\"V58Xw3XzsFFhmTzpnKoKkVPIxe5pYrnU1dx2NtOOcj7QdPPz/d1vqDm+U3tIqM1UEyN/+AL0vcwY8hrgR6Qerw==\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"8135807\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"name\\\\\" id=\\\\\"name\\\\\" value=\\\\\"to-read\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"12_book_8135807\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"wtr_new\\\\\" id=\\\\\"wtr_new\\\\\" value=\\\\\"true\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"ref\\\\\" id=\\\\\"ref\\\\\" value=\\\\\"\\\\\" class=\\\\\"wtrLeftUpRef\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"existing_review\\\\\" id=\\\\\"existing_review\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" class=\\\\\"wtrExisting\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" value=\\\\\"related_works\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" value=\\\\\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10818853-fifty-shades-of-grey\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" value=\\\\\"/book/show/10818853-fifty-shades-of-grey\\\\\" />\\\\n<button class=\\\\\\'wtrToRead\\\\\\' type=\\\\\\'submit\\\\\\'>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\'progressTrigger\\\\\\'>Want to Read<\\\\/span>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\'progressIndicator\\\\\\'>saving…<\\\\/span>\\\\n<\\\\/button>\\\\n<\\\\/form>\\\\n\\\\n<\\\\/div>\\\\n\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'wtrRight wtrUp\\\\\\'>\\\\n<form class=\\\\\"hiddenShelfForm\\\\\" action=\\\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\\\" accept-charset=\\\\\"UTF-8\\\\\" method=\\\\\"post\\\\\"><input name=\\\\\"utf8\\\\\" type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" value=\\\\\"&#x2713;\\\\\" /><input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"authenticity_token\\\\\" value=\\\\\"vB5PyX1X9gNDaiJzOhDvbwNwO54V/t+TJYIlNM5wVOc79av59Xkp+htNTeHuEiiqQ5uBiH5o24vorEniWlo4dg==\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"12_book_8135807\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"8135807\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"a\\\\\" id=\\\\\"a\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"name\\\\\" id=\\\\\"name\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" value=\\\\\"related_works\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" value=\\\\\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10818853-fifty-shades-of-grey\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" value=\\\\\"/book/show/10818853-fifty-shades-of-grey\\\\\" />\\\\n<\\\\/form>\\\\n\\\\n<button class=\\\\\\'wtrShelfButton\\\\\\'><\\\\/button>\\\\n<\\\\/div>\\\\n\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'ratingStars wtrRating\\\\\\'>\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'starsErrorTooltip hidden\\\\\\'>\\\\nError rating book.

Though Anthony Rawlings thought he taught Claire to behave, his domination became desire, and his obsession morphed into love. Or was it? When her choices pushed Anthony\\\\\\'s relentless vendetta too far, Claire barely survived the consequences. \\\\n\\\\nDiscover the truth.\\\\n\\\\nNow, armed with new information and more questions than answers, Claire works to uncover the truth behind the dangerous game at play. As she begins anew, she must decide whom she can truly trust, especially with a new set of players on the move.\\\\n\\\\nNew set of rules.\\\\n\\\\nWith everything to lose and a manipulative game master controlling the board, Claire and Tony duel by a new set of rules. When thrust together once again, can they learn to trust each other to overcome new dangers? Or will this be Tony\\\\\\'s second attempt at domination? Can Claire resist the man she\\\\\\'d never before been able to resist? Hatred and love. Deception and truth. Old habits and new beginnings. As this real-life game of chess plays out, past sins will come to light and new secrets will be revealed. With so much riding on each move, the stakes have never been higher.\\\\n\\\\nAll truths are easy to understand once they are discovered. The trick is to discover them. - Galileo<\\\\/span>\\\\n  <a data-text-id=\\\\\"3011204335392099272\\\\\" href=\\\\\"#\\\\\" onclick=\\\\\"swapContent($(this));; return false;\\\\\">...more<\\\\/a>\\\\n\\\\n    <\\\\/div>\\\\n\\\\n      <div class=\\\\\\'wtrButtonContainer wtrSignedOut\\\\\\' id=\\\\\\'13_book_16070018\\\\\\'>\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'wtrUp wtrLeft\\\\\\'>\\\\n<form action=\\\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\\\" accept-charset=\\\\\"UTF-8\\\\\" method=\\\\\"post\\\\\"><input name=\\\\\"utf8\\\\\" type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" value=\\\\\"&#x2713;\\\\\" /><input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"authenticity_token\\\\\" value=\\\\\"mWFqDZ80qu/LxFP1R/nzKkJKjelozfnO/Y1IWkmU3hgeio49Fxp1FpPjPGeT+zTvAqE3/wNb/dYwoySM3b6yiQ==\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"16070018\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"name\\\\\" id=\\\\\"name\\\\\" value=\\\\\"to-read\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"13_book_16070018\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"wtr_new\\\\\" id=\\\\\"wtr_new\\\\\" value=\\\\\"true\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"ref\\\\\" id=\\\\\"ref\\\\\" value=\\\\\"\\\\\" class=\\\\\"wtrLeftUpRef\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"existing_review\\\\\" id=\\\\\"existing_review\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" class=\\\\\"wtrExisting\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" value=\\\\\"related_works\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" value=\\\\\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10818853-fifty-shades-of-grey\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" value=\\\\\"/book/show/10818853-fifty-shades-of-grey\\\\\" />\\\\n<button class=\\\\\\'wtrToRead\\\\\\' type=\\\\\\'submit\\\\\\'>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\'progressTrigger\\\\\\'>Want to Read<\\\\/span>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\'progressIndicator\\\\\\'>saving…<\\\\/span>\\\\n<\\\\/button>\\\\n<\\\\/form>\\\\n\\\\n<\\\\/div>\\\\n\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'wtrRight wtrUp\\\\\\'>\\\\n<form class=\\\\\"hiddenShelfForm\\\\\" action=\\\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\\\" accept-charset=\\\\\"UTF-8\\\\\" method=\\\\\"post\\\\\"><input name=\\\\\"utf8\\\\\" type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" value=\\\\\"&#x2713;\\\\\" /><input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"authenticity_token\\\\\" value=\\\\\"tNFVxU+x363iZWbeU0Z4ejQyThIgUTWzjCWL8XgDaiwzOrH1x58AVLpCCUyHRL+/dNn0BEvHMatBC+cn7CkGvQ==\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"13_book_16070018\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"16070018\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"a\\\\\" id=\\\\\"a\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"name\\\\\" id=\\\\\"name\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" value=\\\\\"related_works\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" value=\\\\\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10818853-fifty-shades-of-grey\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" value=\\\\\"/book/show/10818853-fifty-shades-of-grey\\\\\" />\\\\n<\\\\/form>\\\\n\\\\n<button class=\\\\\\'wtrShelfButton\\\\\\'><\\\\/button>\\\\n<\\\\/div>\\\\n\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'ratingStars wtrRating\\\\\\'>\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'starsErrorTooltip hidden\\\\\\'>\\\\nError rating book.

She has accepted that she\\\\\\'ll never tame the fierceness in Jesse-and she doesn\\\\\\'t want to. Their love is profound, their connection powerful, but just when she thinks that she\\\\\\'s finally gotten beneath his guarded exterior, more questions arise, leading Ava to believe that Jesse Ward may not be the man she thinks he is. He knows too well how to take her to a place beyond ecstasy . . . but will he also drive her to the brink of despair? It\\\\\\'s time for this man to confess.<\\\\/span>\\\\n  <a data-text-id=\\\\\"16764895737373138199\\\\\" href=\\\\\"#\\\\\" onclick=\\\\\"swapContent($(this));; return false;\\\\\">...more<\\\\/a>\\\\n\\\\n    <\\\\/div>\\\\n\\\\n      <div class=\\\\\\'wtrButtonContainer wtrSignedOut\\\\\\' id=\\\\\\'16_book_17255265\\\\\\'>\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'wtrUp wtrLeft\\\\\\'>\\\\n<form action=\\\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\\\" accept-charset=\\\\\"UTF-8\\\\\" method=\\\\\"post\\\\\"><input name=\\\\\"utf8\\\\\" type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" value=\\\\\"&#x2713;\\\\\" /><input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"authenticity_token\\\\\" value=\\\\\"SwvBj7DTTNEatRnqdRpzlxUkZrmmerR1bL2weCO5/4/M4CW/OP2TKEKSdnihGLRSVc/cr83ssG2hk9yut5OTHg==\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"17255265\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"name\\\\\" id=\\\\\"name\\\\\" value=\\\\\"to-read\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"16_book_17255265\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"wtr_new\\\\\" id=\\\\\"wtr_new\\\\\" value=\\\\\"true\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"ref\\\\\" id=\\\\\"ref\\\\\" value=\\\\\"\\\\\" class=\\\\\"wtrLeftUpRef\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"existing_review\\\\\" id=\\\\\"existing_review\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" class=\\\\\"wtrExisting\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" value=\\\\\"related_works\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" value=\\\\\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10818853-fifty-shades-of-grey\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" value=\\\\\"/book/show/10818853-fifty-shades-of-grey\\\\\" />\\\\n<button class=\\\\\\'wtrToRead\\\\\\' type=\\\\\\'submit\\\\\\'>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\'progressTrigger\\\\\\'>Want to Read<\\\\/span>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\'progressIndicator\\\\\\'>saving…<\\\\/span>\\\\n<\\\\/button>\\\\n<\\\\/form>\\\\n\\\\n<\\\\/div>\\\\n\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'wtrRight wtrUp\\\\\\'>\\\\n<form class=\\\\\"hiddenShelfForm\\\\\" action=\\\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\\\" accept-charset=\\\\\"UTF-8\\\\\" method=\\\\\"post\\\\\"><input name=\\\\\"utf8\\\\\" type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" value=\\\\\"&#x2713;\\\\\" /><input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"authenticity_token\\\\\" value=\\\\\"ZDFacifmvKESf+fHYmg6rX4J27UJa3zei+STW4ku5obj2r5Cr8hjWEpYiFW2av1oPuJho2L9eMZGyv+NHQSKFw==\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"16_book_17255265\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"17255265\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"a\\\\\" id=\\\\\"a\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"name\\\\\" id=\\\\\"name\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" value=\\\\\"related_works\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" value=\\\\\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10818853-fifty-shades-of-grey\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" value=\\\\\"/book/show/10818853-fifty-shades-of-grey\\\\\" />\\\\n<\\\\/form>\\\\n\\\\n<button class=\\\\\\'wtrShelfButton\\\\\\'><\\\\/button>\\\\n<\\\\/div>\\\\n\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'ratingStars wtrRating\\\\\\'>\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'starsErrorTooltip hidden\\\\\\'>\\\\nError rating book.

Now a veterinarian, MacKensie\\\\\\'s turned her life around, but the scars remain. She saves her affection for the animals who never judge or scorn her, but it\\\\\\'s time to get out, move on from her past in Iowa. So, she arranges a vacation exchange to job hunt in Seattle. Although the house is lovely, one room is locked. Her years in foster care have given her two ‘gifts’: a neurosis about locked doors and the ability to open them. After she gets into the room, she\\\\\\'s appalled…and intrigued. Chains and manacles, whips and paddles, odd benches with straps… When Alex returns home days early and finds MacKensie draped over the spanking bench in his locked dungeon, he’s furious. But her wariness arouses his protective nature and curiosity, so he strikes a deal to keep her close—she’ll act as his submissive in exchange for a place to stay and help finding a job. He’d planned to use the veterinarian to deter an ex-girlfriend, not replace her, but with MacKensie’s compelling mixture of strength and vulnerability, the little sub slides right into his well-defended heart. <\\\\/span>\\\\n  <a data-text-id=\\\\\"8375612014659708326\\\\\" href=\\\\\"#\\\\\" onclick=\\\\\"swapContent($(this));; return false;\\\\\">...more<\\\\/a>\\\\n\\\\n    <\\\\/div>\\\\n\\\\n      <div class=\\\\\\'wtrButtonContainer wtrSignedOut\\\\\\' id=\\\\\\'18_book_19453641\\\\\\'>\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'wtrUp wtrLeft\\\\\\'>\\\\n<form action=\\\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\\\" accept-charset=\\\\\"UTF-8\\\\\" method=\\\\\"post\\\\\"><input name=\\\\\"utf8\\\\\" type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" value=\\\\\"&#x2713;\\\\\" /><input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"authenticity_token\\\\\" value=\\\\\"8f6QaRrWO2MYut6BJ8btjcjayQIcU7erFi2OTgeZDCt2FXRZkvjkmkCdsRPzxCpIiDFzFHfFs7PbA+KYk7Ngug==\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"19453641\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"name\\\\\" id=\\\\\"name\\\\\" value=\\\\\"to-read\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"18_book_19453641\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"wtr_new\\\\\" id=\\\\\"wtr_new\\\\\" value=\\\\\"true\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"ref\\\\\" id=\\\\\"ref\\\\\" value=\\\\\"\\\\\" class=\\\\\"wtrLeftUpRef\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"existing_review\\\\\" id=\\\\\"existing_review\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" class=\\\\\"wtrExisting\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" value=\\\\\"related_works\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" value=\\\\\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10818853-fifty-shades-of-grey\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" value=\\\\\"/book/show/10818853-fifty-shades-of-grey\\\\\" />\\\\n<button class=\\\\\\'wtrToRead\\\\\\' type=\\\\\\'submit\\\\\\'>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\'progressTrigger\\\\\\'>Want to Read<\\\\/span>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\'progressIndicator\\\\\\'>saving…<\\\\/span>\\\\n<\\\\/button>\\\\n<\\\\/form>\\\\n\\\\n<\\\\/div>\\\\n\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'wtrRight wtrUp\\\\\\'>\\\\n<form class=\\\\\"hiddenShelfForm\\\\\" action=\\\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\\\" accept-charset=\\\\\"UTF-8\\\\\" method=\\\\\"post\\\\\"><input name=\\\\\"utf8\\\\\" type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" value=\\\\\"&#x2713;\\\\\" /><input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"authenticity_token\\\\\" value=\\\\\"GcdpENnTH1C+8x0XtryEzUtZv1ZvrxaDyMvQ58N0rgCeLI0gUf3AqebUcoVivkMIC7IFQAQ5EpsF5bwxV17CkQ==\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"18_book_19453641\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"19453641\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"a\\\\\" id=\\\\\"a\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"name\\\\\" id=\\\\\"name\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" value=\\\\\"related_works\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" value=\\\\\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10818853-fifty-shades-of-grey\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" value=\\\\\"/book/show/10818853-fifty-shades-of-grey\\\\\" />\\\\n<\\\\/form>\\\\n\\\\n<button class=\\\\\\'wtrShelfButton\\\\\\'><\\\\/button>\\\\n<\\\\/div>\\\\n\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'ratingStars wtrRating\\\\\\'>\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'starsErrorTooltip hidden\\\\\\'>\\\\nError rating book.

While her longtime lover, Søren—whose fetishes, if exposed, would be his ruin—is under scrutiny pending a major promotion, Nora\\\\\\'s lying low and away from temptation in the lap of luxury.\\\\n\\\\nHer host, the wealthy and uninhibited Griffin Fiske, is thrilled to have Nora stay at his country estate, especially once he meets her traveling companion. Young, inexperienced and angelically beautiful, Michael has become Nora\\\\\\'s protégé, and this summer with Griffin is going to be his training, where the hazing never ends.\\\\n\\\\nBut while her flesh is willing, Nora\\\\\\'s mind is wandering. To thoughts of Søren, her master, under investigation by a journalist with an ax to grind. And to another man from Nora\\\\\\'s past, whose hold on her is less bruising, but whose secrets are no less painful. It\\\\\\'s a summer that will prove the old adage: love hurts.<\\\\/span>\\\\n  <a data-text-id=\\\\\"7526414495969702292\\\\\" href=\\\\\"#\\\\\" onclick=\\\\\"swapContent($(this));; return false;\\\\\">...more<\\\\/a>\\\\n\\\\n    <\\\\/div>\\\\n\\\\n      <div class=\\\\\\'wtrButtonContainer wtrSignedOut\\\\\\' id=\\\\\\'19_book_13548075\\\\\\'>\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'wtrUp wtrLeft\\\\\\'>\\\\n<form action=\\\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\\\" accept-charset=\\\\\"UTF-8\\\\\" method=\\\\\"post\\\\\"><input name=\\\\\"utf8\\\\\" type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" value=\\\\\"&#x2713;\\\\\" /><input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"authenticity_token\\\\\" value=\\\\\"t6GS5QeIsjH2iMdmW9DqcFD/WY6OtxiSowTRwNau6lAwSnbVj6ZtyK6vqPSP0i21EBTjmOUhHIpuKr0WQoSGwQ==\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"13548075\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"name\\\\\" id=\\\\\"name\\\\\" value=\\\\\"to-read\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"19_book_13548075\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"wtr_new\\\\\" id=\\\\\"wtr_new\\\\\" value=\\\\\"true\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"ref\\\\\" id=\\\\\"ref\\\\\" value=\\\\\"\\\\\" class=\\\\\"wtrLeftUpRef\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"existing_review\\\\\" id=\\\\\"existing_review\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" class=\\\\\"wtrExisting\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" value=\\\\\"related_works\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" value=\\\\\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10818853-fifty-shades-of-grey\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" value=\\\\\"/book/show/10818853-fifty-shades-of-grey\\\\\" />\\\\n<button class=\\\\\\'wtrToRead\\\\\\' type=\\\\\\'submit\\\\\\'>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\'progressTrigger\\\\\\'>Want to Read<\\\\/span>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\'progressIndicator\\\\\\'>saving…<\\\\/span>\\\\n<\\\\/button>\\\\n<\\\\/form>\\\\n\\\\n<\\\\/div>\\\\n\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'wtrRight wtrUp\\\\\\'>\\\\n<form class=\\\\\"hiddenShelfForm\\\\\" action=\\\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\\\" accept-charset=\\\\\"UTF-8\\\\\" method=\\\\\"post\\\\\"><input name=\\\\\"utf8\\\\\" type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" value=\\\\\"&#x2713;\\\\\" /><input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"authenticity_token\\\\\" value=\\\\\"vwV/fRQuAEExLz6mZBU/k/kPo2GmVvwE7lW74Y6fbdE47ptNnADfuGkIUTSwF/hWueQZd83A+Bwje9c3GrUBQA==\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"19_book_13548075\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"13548075\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"a\\\\\" id=\\\\\"a\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"name\\\\\" id=\\\\\"name\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" value=\\\\\"related_works\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" value=\\\\\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10818853-fifty-shades-of-grey\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" value=\\\\\"/book/show/10818853-fifty-shades-of-grey\\\\\" />\\\\n<\\\\/form>\\\\n\\\\n<button class=\\\\\\'wtrShelfButton\\\\\\'><\\\\/button>\\\\n<\\\\/div>\\\\n\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'ratingStars wtrRating\\\\\\'>\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'starsErrorTooltip hidden\\\\\\'>\\\\nError rating book.

Forgetting her past isn’t an option. It is an integral part of who she is now, and it will forever shape her view of life. The one thing she knows is that she cannot imagine her life without the man who saved her, but can she be what he needs? \\\\n\\\\nStephan never imagined falling in love with the woman he rescued, but the thought of her no longer being part of his life is physically painful.

Tyler Murphy was an LAPD detective, single and happy—until a near-fatal tragedy crippled his friend, fellow detective Eric Catalano. While Tyler supported Eric, he also became a shoulder for Eric’s wife, Delaney, to lean on. But with one naughty suggestion from Eric, a drunken night with Delaney spilled into erotic abandon. Before it was over, Tyler saw his best friend’s wife as a woman and yearned for more. When Eric struggled to deal with the aftermath, Delaney begged Tyler to leave. Crushed, he fled to Louisiana, hoping to escape his longing for the one woman he could never have again…and unaware of what he’d left behind.A lover’s desire. After two years of living with regret, Tyler finds Delaney on his doorstep, her husband having abandoned her long ago. She’s protecting a shocking secret and desperately needs refuge from a stalker determined to see her dead. As they fight to stay alive and catch the killer, they struggle to resolve the guilt of their past pleasures. But they can’t deny that what was once a spark is now a flame burning out of control. To possess Delaney—body and soul—Tyler must heal her pain and thwart the evil that’s a mere breath behind her… MATURE AUDIENCE<\\\\/span>\\\\n  <a data-text-id=\\\\\"15388518785548781666\\\\\" href=\\\\\"#\\\\\" onclick=\\\\\"swapContent($(this));; return false;\\\\\">...more<\\\\/a>\\\\n\\\\n    <\\\\/div>\\\\n\\\\n      <div class=\\\\\\'wtrButtonContainer wtrSignedOut\\\\\\' id=\\\\\\'23_book_16087848\\\\\\'>\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'wtrUp wtrLeft\\\\\\'>\\\\n<form action=\\\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\\\" accept-charset=\\\\\"UTF-8\\\\\" method=\\\\\"post\\\\\"><input name=\\\\\"utf8\\\\\" type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" value=\\\\\"&#x2713;\\\\\" /><input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"authenticity_token\\\\\" value=\\\\\"vqI0IidpfFJkK9lxV0W6BbA1o5Q//5uYOnWiRkDFm2I5SdASr0ejqzwMtuODR33A8N4ZglRpn4D3W86Q1O/38w==\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"16087848\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"name\\\\\" id=\\\\\"name\\\\\" value=\\\\\"to-read\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"23_book_16087848\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"wtr_new\\\\\" id=\\\\\"wtr_new\\\\\" value=\\\\\"true\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"ref\\\\\" id=\\\\\"ref\\\\\" value=\\\\\"\\\\\" class=\\\\\"wtrLeftUpRef\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"existing_review\\\\\" id=\\\\\"existing_review\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" class=\\\\\"wtrExisting\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" value=\\\\\"related_works\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" value=\\\\\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10818853-fifty-shades-of-grey\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" value=\\\\\"/book/show/10818853-fifty-shades-of-grey\\\\\" />\\\\n<button class=\\\\\\'wtrToRead\\\\\\' type=\\\\\\'submit\\\\\\'>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\'progressTrigger\\\\\\'>Want to Read<\\\\/span>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\'progressIndicator\\\\\\'>saving…<\\\\/span>\\\\n<\\\\/button>\\\\n<\\\\/form>\\\\n\\\\n<\\\\/div>\\\\n\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'wtrRight wtrUp\\\\\\'>\\\\n<form class=\\\\\"hiddenShelfForm\\\\\" action=\\\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\\\" accept-charset=\\\\\"UTF-8\\\\\" method=\\\\\"post\\\\\"><input name=\\\\\"utf8\\\\\" type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" value=\\\\\"&#x2713;\\\\\" /><input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"authenticity_token\\\\\" value=\\\\\"9larEYqmD+f9YMXt3oc0wkPLnYP6l9V9l0kklyULejFxvU8hAojQHqVHqn8KhfMHAyAnlZEB0WVaZ0hBsSEWoA==\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"23_book_16087848\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"16087848\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"a\\\\\" id=\\\\\"a\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"name\\\\\" id=\\\\\"name\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" value=\\\\\"related_works\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" value=\\\\\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10818853-fifty-shades-of-grey\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" value=\\\\\"/book/show/10818853-fifty-shades-of-grey\\\\\" />\\\\n<\\\\/form>\\\\n\\\\n<button class=\\\\\\'wtrShelfButton\\\\\\'><\\\\/button>\\\\n<\\\\/div>\\\\n\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'ratingStars wtrRating\\\\\\'>\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'starsErrorTooltip hidden\\\\\\'>\\\\nError rating book.

But desire for Christian still dominates her every waking thought, and when he proposes a new arrangement, Anastasia cannot resist. They rekindle their searing sensual affair, and Anastasia learns more about the harrowing past of her damaged, driven, and demanding Fifty Shades. While Christian wrestles with his inner demons, Anastasia must confront her anger and envy of the women who came before her and make the most important decision of her life. Erotic, sparkling and suspenseful, Fifty Shades Darker is the irresistibly addictive second part of the Fifty Shades trilogy.<\\\\/span>\\\\n  <a data-text-id=\\\\\"1569336933817175478\\\\\" href=\\\\\"#\\\\\" onclick=\\\\\"swapContent($(this));; return false;\\\\\">...more<\\\\/a>\\\\n\\\\n    <\\\\/div>\\\\n\\\\n      <div class=\\\\\\'wtrButtonContainer wtrSignedOut\\\\\\' id=\\\\\\'24_book_11857408\\\\\\'>\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'wtrUp wtrLeft\\\\\\'>\\\\n<form action=\\\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\\\" accept-charset=\\\\\"UTF-8\\\\\" method=\\\\\"post\\\\\"><input name=\\\\\"utf8\\\\\" type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" value=\\\\\"&#x2713;\\\\\" /><input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"authenticity_token\\\\\" value=\\\\\"b/8kvHUOBLBM2tPDwDMsY8u2KzBxWg26sV8stYK1euvoFMCM/SDbSRT9vFEUMeumi12RJhrMCaJ8cUBjFp8Weg==\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"11857408\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"name\\\\\" id=\\\\\"name\\\\\" value=\\\\\"to-read\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"24_book_11857408\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"wtr_new\\\\\" id=\\\\\"wtr_new\\\\\" value=\\\\\"true\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"ref\\\\\" id=\\\\\"ref\\\\\" value=\\\\\"\\\\\" class=\\\\\"wtrLeftUpRef\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"existing_review\\\\\" id=\\\\\"existing_review\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" class=\\\\\"wtrExisting\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" value=\\\\\"series_works\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" value=\\\\\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10818853-fifty-shades-of-grey\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" value=\\\\\"/book/show/10818853-fifty-shades-of-grey\\\\\" />\\\\n<button class=\\\\\\'wtrToRead\\\\\\' type=\\\\\\'submit\\\\\\'>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\'progressTrigger\\\\\\'>Want to Read<\\\\/span>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\'progressIndicator\\\\\\'>saving…<\\\\/span>\\\\n<\\\\/button>\\\\n<\\\\/form>\\\\n\\\\n<\\\\/div>\\\\n\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'wtrRight wtrUp\\\\\\'>\\\\n<form class=\\\\\"hiddenShelfForm\\\\\" action=\\\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\\\" accept-charset=\\\\\"UTF-8\\\\\" method=\\\\\"post\\\\\"><input name=\\\\\"utf8\\\\\" type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" value=\\\\\"&#x2713;\\\\\" /><input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"authenticity_token\\\\\" value=\\\\\"tIAWl1FcoyRnarmcQKy7i/ySPE7jv9HgJIP4+l4QWukza/Kn2XJ83T9N1g6UrnxOvHmGWIgp1fjprZQsyjo2eA==\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"24_book_11857408\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"11857408\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"a\\\\\" id=\\\\\"a\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"name\\\\\" id=\\\\\"name\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" value=\\\\\"series_works\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" value=\\\\\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10818853-fifty-shades-of-grey\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" value=\\\\\"/book/show/10818853-fifty-shades-of-grey\\\\\" />\\\\n<\\\\/form>\\\\n\\\\n<button class=\\\\\\'wtrShelfButton\\\\\\'><\\\\/button>\\\\n<\\\\/div>\\\\n\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'ratingStars wtrRating\\\\\\'>\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'starsErrorTooltip hidden\\\\\\'>\\\\nError rating book.

Shocked, intrigued, and, ultimately, repelled by Christian’s singular erotic tastes, Ana demands a deeper commitment. Determined to keep her, Christian agrees.\\\\n\\\\nNow, Ana and Christian have it all—love, passion, intimacy, wealth, and a world of possibilities for their future.\\xa0But Ana knows that loving her Fifty Shades will not be easy, and that being together will pose challenges that neither of them would anticipate.\\xa0Ana must somehow learn to share Christian’s opulent lifestyle without sacrificing her own identity. And Christian must overcome his compulsion to control as he wrestles with the demons of a tormented past.\\\\n\\\\nJust when it seems that their strength together will eclipse any obstacle, misfortune, malice, and fate conspire to make Ana’s deepest fears turn to reality.\\\\n\\\\nThis book is intended for mature audiences.<\\\\/span>\\\\n  <a data-text-id=\\\\\"12761810012722042354\\\\\" href=\\\\\"#\\\\\" onclick=\\\\\"swapContent($(this));; return false;\\\\\">...more<\\\\/a>\\\\n\\\\n    <\\\\/div>\\\\n\\\\n      <div class=\\\\\\'wtrButtonContainer wtrSignedOut\\\\\\' id=\\\\\\'25_book_13536860\\\\\\'>\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'wtrUp wtrLeft\\\\\\'>\\\\n<form action=\\\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\\\" accept-charset=\\\\\"UTF-8\\\\\" method=\\\\\"post\\\\\"><input name=\\\\\"utf8\\\\\" type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" value=\\\\\"&#x2713;\\\\\" /><input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"authenticity_token\\\\\" value=\\\\\"iEOGKDStlLfOhTgaHU9wAfa0ewGPC4mBGICPfJ32yZYPqGIYvINLTpaiV4jJTbfEtl/BF+SdjZnVruOqCdylBw==\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"13536860\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"name\\\\\" id=\\\\\"name\\\\\" value=\\\\\"to-read\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"25_book_13536860\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"wtr_new\\\\\" id=\\\\\"wtr_new\\\\\" value=\\\\\"true\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"ref\\\\\" id=\\\\\"ref\\\\\" value=\\\\\"\\\\\" class=\\\\\"wtrLeftUpRef\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"existing_review\\\\\" id=\\\\\"existing_review\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" class=\\\\\"wtrExisting\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" value=\\\\\"series_works\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" value=\\\\\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10818853-fifty-shades-of-grey\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" value=\\\\\"/book/show/10818853-fifty-shades-of-grey\\\\\" />\\\\n<button class=\\\\\\'wtrToRead\\\\\\' type=\\\\\\'submit\\\\\\'>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\'progressTrigger\\\\\\'>Want to Read<\\\\/span>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\'progressIndicator\\\\\\'>saving…<\\\\/span>\\\\n<\\\\/button>\\\\n<\\\\/form>\\\\n\\\\n<\\\\/div>\\\\n\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'wtrRight wtrUp\\\\\\'>\\\\n<form class=\\\\\"hiddenShelfForm\\\\\" action=\\\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\\\" accept-charset=\\\\\"UTF-8\\\\\" method=\\\\\"post\\\\\"><input name=\\\\\"utf8\\\\\" type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" value=\\\\\"&#x2713;\\\\\" /><input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"authenticity_token\\\\\" value=\\\\\"ty+DslU1maiqrVtgSifyzz4w1VyZOHR4/6bGt96fCxQwxGeC3RtGUfKKNPKeJTUKfttvSvKucGAyiKphSrVnhQ==\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"25_book_13536860\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"13536860\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"a\\\\\" id=\\\\\"a\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"name\\\\\" id=\\\\\"name\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" value=\\\\\"series_works\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" value=\\\\\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10818853-fifty-shades-of-grey\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" value=\\\\\"/book/show/10818853-fifty-shades-of-grey\\\\\" />\\\\n<\\\\/form>\\\\n\\\\n<button class=\\\\\\'wtrShelfButton\\\\\\'><\\\\/button>\\\\n<\\\\/div>\\\\n\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'ratingStars wtrRating\\\\\\'>\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'starsErrorTooltip hidden\\\\\\'>\\\\nError rating book.

Or will his dark sexual desires, his compulsion to control, and the self-loathing that fills his soul drive this girl away and destroy the fragile hope she offers him?This book is intended for mature audiences.<\\\\/span>\\\\n  <a data-text-id=\\\\\"3663813210500716722\\\\\" href=\\\\\"#\\\\\" onclick=\\\\\"swapContent($(this));; return false;\\\\\">...more<\\\\/a>\\\\n\\\\n    <\\\\/div>\\\\n\\\\n      <div class=\\\\\\'wtrButtonContainer wtrSignedOut\\\\\\' id=\\\\\\'26_book_25644601\\\\\\'>\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'wtrUp wtrLeft\\\\\\'>\\\\n<form action=\\\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\\\" accept-charset=\\\\\"UTF-8\\\\\" method=\\\\\"post\\\\\"><input name=\\\\\"utf8\\\\\" type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" value=\\\\\"&#x2713;\\\\\" /><input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"authenticity_token\\\\\" value=\\\\\"hMir6eOle4IFXp2+fsM7GEPtcga69SELAYWuljFU3tUDI0/Za4uke1158iyqwfzdAwbIENFjJRPMq8JApX6yRA==\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"25644601\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"name\\\\\" id=\\\\\"name\\\\\" value=\\\\\"to-read\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"26_book_25644601\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"wtr_new\\\\\" id=\\\\\"wtr_new\\\\\" value=\\\\\"true\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"ref\\\\\" id=\\\\\"ref\\\\\" value=\\\\\"\\\\\" class=\\\\\"wtrLeftUpRef\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"existing_review\\\\\" id=\\\\\"existing_review\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" class=\\\\\"wtrExisting\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" value=\\\\\"series_works\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" value=\\\\\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10818853-fifty-shades-of-grey\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" value=\\\\\"/book/show/10818853-fifty-shades-of-grey\\\\\" />\\\\n<button class=\\\\\\'wtrToRead\\\\\\' type=\\\\\\'submit\\\\\\'>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\'progressTrigger\\\\\\'>Want to Read<\\\\/span>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\'progressIndicator\\\\\\'>saving…<\\\\/span>\\\\n<\\\\/button>\\\\n<\\\\/form>\\\\n\\\\n<\\\\/div>\\\\n\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'wtrRight wtrUp\\\\\\'>\\\\n<form class=\\\\\"hiddenShelfForm\\\\\" action=\\\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\\\" accept-charset=\\\\\"UTF-8\\\\\" method=\\\\\"post\\\\\"><input name=\\\\\"utf8\\\\\" type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" value=\\\\\"&#x2713;\\\\\" /><input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"authenticity_token\\\\\" value=\\\\\"JsU4HFyclepqHS1cGFRf0IcuYSUsEWPBbAH5L65A8nWhLtws1LJKEzI6Qs7MVpgVx8XbM0eHZ9mhL5X5Omqe5A==\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"26_book_25644601\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"25644601\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"a\\\\\" id=\\\\\"a\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"name\\\\\" id=\\\\\"name\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_origin\\\\\" value=\\\\\"series_works\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_referrer\\\\\" value=\\\\\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10818853-fifty-shades-of-grey\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" value=\\\\\"/book/show/10818853-fifty-shades-of-grey\\\\\" />\\\\n<\\\\/form>\\\\n\\\\n<button class=\\\\\\'wtrShelfButton\\\\\\'><\\\\/button>\\\\n<\\\\/div>\\\\n\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'ratingStars wtrRating\\\\\\'>\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'starsErrorTooltip hidden\\\\\\'>\\\\nError rating book.

       "  'Overall, I thought Alex, Approximately was a cute and sweet quick read. Perfect for the beach! :)However, there were a few things that bothered me about this novel:- I, unfortunately, can\\'t help but compare this to Things We Know By Heart, which is insanely similar to this novel. I mean, the concept isn\\'t anything new, but the similarities between the novels: wow. Ultimately, I liked both novels about the same, but (view spoiler)[ one thing the Things We Know By Heart gets right is the fact that one of the main characters knows the truth throughout the whole novel. Even in You\\'ve Got Mail, Tom Hanks knows pretty quickly who exactly Meg Ryan is. For some reason, the fact that the characters in Alex, Approximately don\\'t learn the truth until the end of the book makes it weird. I honestly can\\'t put my finger on why exactly it\\'s weird, but for some reason the biggest \"hook\" of the whole novel falls a little flat to me.  (hide spoiler)]- Porter: while I learned to really like the character, first impression: I hate this guy. He doesn\\'t come off very likable in the first couple of chapters and then those actions don\\'t really mesh with the person he turns out to be in the rest of the novel. It\\'s like the author was trying to create this witty banter between them (a sort of love/hate situation) and instead Porter is just flat out MEAN. I really didn\\'t understand that.- Eye-rolling Subplot/Scenes: The whole subplot with Davy made me roll my eyes. It wasn\\'t necessary. at. all. (view spoiler)[ I also found the \"steamy\" scenes to be cringeworthy at various points. There is an art to writing romantic scenes, especially in a YA novel, and some of them in the book were just not good.  (hide spoiler)]- Lastly (and totally minor), the cover! I love the artwork, but in no way doesn\\'t it have anything do with the book other than it looks like they might be watching a movie. Why is there a pool? This book takes place at the beach?!? I just don\\'t get it!Overall, I\\'ll give this novel 3 stars because there were just too many minor things that bothered me about this book. However, I would still recommend this for someone looking for a cute, romantic YA novel. - ',\n",

When I began this book, the premise sounded great and I expected something saturated in cheese and possibly overly sweet...I wasn\\'t quite sure. But it ended up actually having some really heavy elements to it, and the writing was so smart and well done and the romance part is definitely not too sweet- it\\'s a bit more advanced but the characters are older so I thought it was a good fit. The dialogue is great and the characters have great depth. But back to the writing- so good! Her metaphors are unique and not overwrought. I did think that the words \"Artful Dodger\" were used way too much in about the first 30% of the book. That got toned down in the rest though, so it didn\\'t end up being annoying. As I was reading this, I was saying to myself \"I will now read anything Jenn Bennett has ever written,\" stupidly not realizing that she wrote Night Owls which I have on my shelf and will be reading next.

However, that being said it  is your classic contemporary summer romance. There's just something so addicting about this book that I read all of it in essentially two sittings. I feel like I could relate to the characters for the most part, occasionally I just had to face palm a little at some parts. Overall, a really solid book, and if you enjoy a good YA romance, you'll most likely enjoy this one.(view spoiler)[Okay, now some spoilers. The two main things about this book that just, I couldn't deal with. My worst enemies- miscommunication and a romance trope that drives me nuts. So, the end of the book could've been solved IF BAILEY JUST TALKED TO PORTER AND JUST WAS HONEST. Like okay, I understand how she's scared and avoids confrontation- like girl believe me I'm there with you. But seriously, if there's a problem with your relationship, you need to be communicating with him and fix it. Now. The second issue I had. The romance trope. The trope that in order for a relationship to mean something/be meaningful/ for the couple to actually in love- they gotta have sex. Or even just a YA couple having sex because ya gotta apparently. Just. You know what I mean? When the couple has only been together for like some odd months (*cough* or the summer) and they just gotta have sex. There's some serious unresolved sexual tension. I just. YOU DON'T NEED TO INCLUDE SEX IN YOUR BOOKS YA AUTHORS. I AM LETTING YOU KNOW THAT SEX DOES NOT EQUATE TO THE BEST GOSH DARN RELATIONSHIP. Just. Yeah. I would like to see a YA romance novel where a couple doesn't have sex after only being together for some months. One day maybe.  (hide spoiler)]\",\n",

I laughed out loud (literally) multiple times, especially \"she has the strength of a tater tot\"-The premise really drew me in, as You\\'ve Got Mail is probably one of my favorite rom-coms ever-Although this is a contemporary novel, the world-building was excellent, something not normally seen in this genre.-Bennett dives further into more graphic and adult topics while still keeping it light-hearted and fun and one does not detract from the other-Bailey wants to be a curator!! Yay job representation!!The Not So Good:-The \\'miscommunication\\'/\\'misunderstanding\\' trope is rife in this novel, which I particularly find immensely frustrating-Bailey and Porter\\'s relationship can be wishy-washy at times, they\\'ll be happy one minute and arguing (not bantering, there\\'s a difference) the next. While I understand Bennett was utilizing the \\'hate to love\\' trope, there\\'s a sharp contrast between playful banter, which they have a lot, to yelling at one another at the drop of a hat.Would I Recommend It?Absolutely! While I did have some problems with the book, it\\'s a great summer read filled with laughter and fun yet still keeping an edge. However, I wish the publishers didn\\'t market it as a \"You\\'ve Got Mail for teens\", because it\\'s really not. I can see how it has elements of the main plot of the film in it, but the online chat forum turns out to be only a minuscule point in Alex, Approximately. I could have been overly disappointed in the plot because I know the source material like the back of my hand, but don\\'t market your book to be something it isn\\'t. (Also watch the film it\\'s 11/10)Rating:4/5; B-Favorite Quote:Truthfully, the tater tot one is, but here\\'s my second favorite:\"But just when you think you understand someone, it turns out that you didn\\'t know them at all.

I mean, you can kind of predict how the book will end, but it's a matter of how it gets there that made it worthwhile.The main female character is Bailey Rydell (and every time I read her last name, I though of Rydell High from Grease). She starts her summer by moving across the country to live with her dad. I love how carefree she is and admits that she's a flawed person. She deals with a lot in regards to her family life, but she's trying to make herself better by admitting that she has faults. She's a very likeable person.Her father arranges for her to have a summer job at a nearby museum. She immediately clicks with another teenage girl, and the two become close. Throw in Porter, who is a member of a well-known area family due to his family's success in surfing. He is a completely likeable person from the very beginning, as he's charming and flirty without being overly cocky. I absolutely loved the banter between Baily and Porter.In the mix of all of this is a man named Alex who Bailey has been communicating with via a chat forum. Coincidently, Alex lives in the same town as her father, and Bailey struggles with letting Alex know she's in town vs. slowly developing feelings for Porter.The chemistry between Bailey and Porter was so sweet and swoon-worthy. I couldn't get enough of the two of them and was silently rooting them on. It was a refreshing, fun read and I was sad to finish it so quickly.

I guess I wished the book would either really lean into fluff or angst, and instead it just tiptoed around both in a way that was kind of unsatisfying. Like there was a decent amount of trauma and background for the different characters that felt... really superficial. Also some storylines felt superfluous and unresolved. (view spoiler)[i.e. Davy and the missing mom. I was pretty disturbed by the lack of communication from the mom completely. (hide spoiler)] Learning that Jenn Bennet has a background as a romance writer explains A LOT about how I felt about the plot and background though. I did really like how there was an emphasis on different cultures, such as Porter was Hawaiian and Grace was Nigerian (Grace was also tragically underused and underdeveloped.) The movie obsession was cute, but it also made me laugh because the characters felt so genuinely like teenagers in that moment. Like they talk about a lot of really famous movies, yet Bailey and Porter seemed surprised the other knew the films. I think I was a bit hesitant because You've Got Mail is one of my favorite films and some of the charm of that movie was missing here. About halfway into the book, it really seems like the online flirtation didn't matter anymore, so towards the end when Bailey feels torn didn't quite have the emotional satisfaction I could've hoped for. (The story behind her nickname was very cute). Also by making Bailey's family paranoid of using social media and thus her reason for the ~secrecy~ of talking to a strange online kind of felt like a cop out instead of finding a way to adapt the You've Got Mail storyline into a modern setting.\",\n",

The female lead isn\\'t perfect or overly \"adorkable.\" She had flaws, and a wide range of interests that seem natural instead of an author trying to give a character dimension.

       " ['This review reveals what some might think of as a spoiler as to the offline identity of \"Alex\", but really, a blind person could tell who that is!Up until Porter found out Baileyâ\\x80\\x99s online identity, I really didnâ\\x80\\x99t have any strong feelings about our â\\x80\\x9cheroâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x93 I neither thought he was a great Book Boyfriend, nor did I think he was unworthy of being the main male character. However, that all changed after The Reveal. Then, I thought he was an utter a**hat, a real hypocrite with all his fine talk about truth and honesty, and then essentially treats Bailey like something that needs to be scraped off the bottom of his shoe.When he realizes that Bailey never â\\x80\\x9cplayedâ\\x80\\x9d him or his online persona of Alex, then he relents and magnanimously deigns to talk to her, but even then, he offhandedly portrays blowing her off as some misunderstanding, rather than tell her the truth. To her credit, Bailey doesnâ\\x80\\x99t immediately relent; she is rightfully still hurt and confused and wonâ\\x80\\x99t do the kiss and makeup that Porter wants until she gets some answers. Good on her!But, as to that, Bailey has fairly consistently shown backbone throughout the novel, beginning with tackling the would-be Maltese Falcon thieves, all the way to her epic meltdown in the HotBox. Thus, I felt the author did a disservice to the character by labeling her the Artful Dodger time and again in the book. We readers see very little of that.Frankly, I thought the novel should have dealt a lot more with Baileyâ\\x80\\x99s PTSD concerning the incident with Greg. One gets the sense that even with all the therapy she underwent, there were still unresolved issues and feelings stemming from The Incident. And a major part of the unresolved issue involves Baileyâ\\x80\\x99s mom. Itâ\\x80\\x99s so unreal that her mom basically chose not to contact Bailey all summer! Yes, so they never had an exceptionally close mother-daughter bond in the first place, but the mom character comes across as a narcissistic, unfeeling, person â\\x80\\x93 someone who was the true Artful Dodger of the story. The pace of the story was slow. Because the story was fairly unoriginal (itâ\\x80\\x99s basically â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99ve Got Mailâ\\x80\\x9d but set in the YA milieu), the characters, pacing and narrative needed to elevate the plot, but alas, that was not to be.I thought Grace, Baileyâ\\x80\\x99s BFF was the best character in this book. She was fun, spunky and heck, who doesnâ\\x80\\x99t love a British accent?As for the best part of the book for me? It was the inclusion of a Star Wars quote.

I use these kind of stories for palate cleansers in between heavier books and for days where I donâ\\x80\\x99t want to be disturbed or sad (birthdays, holidays, vacation). So when I read about Alex, Approximately in several review journals, where it received lots of good reviews, I mentally filed it away for a day that I would need it.That day, it turned out, was this past Saturday, during my Birthday weekend. It was a warm and sunny day, one of the few weâ\\x80\\x99ve had this season, and I just wanted to relax on the porch with a book. Alex, Approximately, turned out to be the icing on this relaxing cake of a day. Described as a kind of YA version of You Got Mail, this delightful teenage romp follows 17-year old Bailey â\\x80\\x9cMinkâ\\x80\\x9d Rydell, as she moves across the country to live with her Dad in an idyllic California coastal town. Bailey is a classic movie buff and has made online friends with a fellow movie buff named â\\x80\\x9cAlex,â\\x80\\x9d who also happens to live in this idyllic coastal town. Unsure whether she is ready to tell this online person that she has moved close by, the guarded and (literally, it turns out) gunshy Bailey decides to scope him out in person before revealing herself as his online friend. He could be a creep for all she knows! As you can imagine, hijinx ensue as Bailey quickly falls for her cocky, handsome surfer boy coworker. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll let you fill in the Youâ\\x80\\x99ve Got Mail parallels for yourself.I fully expected the usual romantic comedy plot line of meet cute, misunderstanding/breakup, resolution/reunion. While some of the usual tropes exist in this sweet story, it features an edge and a depth that I didnâ\\x80\\x99t expect. Both Bailey and her love interest have a traumatic experience in their past that keeps them from being completely straight forward with each other and others. And a troubled local teen with a serious drug problem frequently shows up to bring real menace to their otherwise idyllic life. Still, Bennett has written an entirely pleasurable story that will keep you interested, invested and most importantly, distracted.

I wish this book had fallen into my hands when I was a 17 yo, completely confused and hormonal driven and just...frankly? Kind of a dumbass (I read Twilight like my life depended on in-nuff said). Because if I had read this story back then I think it would have strengthened me as a person! Besides of course making me laugh my ass off.So, dear (few yet very lovely) Goodreads friends, I give you 'Alex, approximately'. A story about two teenagers who have been hurt (dreadfully I might add) along with their families and their friends. A story about love in the most unlikely places (seriously creepy museum). A story where you will laugh and cry and be giddy and stop every couple of chapters just because you want to drag the story out for as long as you can hold out! I give you one of my top ten books of the year! I'm pretty sure Jenn Bennett is a witch or something. She has to have done witchcraft (possibly...maybe? whatever. not the point, leila, gawd.) All the characters were carefully crafted in such a way that within the span of a couple of pages not only are you hooked, but you fall in love with them. I fell in love with Bailey and her struggles and her strength and wit. I fell in love with Porter and his ridiculously sexy charm and nerdiness. I fell in love with the families and friends! I fell in love with this amazing tiny town in Northern California (if I am ever in the area I am SOOO tracking this place down). You'll see. Trust me. Also, can Bailey and Grace be my best friends?

Maybe the characters lacked in depth a little (specially since I felt that some descriptions were unnecessary and the main character POV was a bit repetitive at times) but it didn\\'t bother that much because CUTENESS OVERCOMES EVERYTHING. But in all seriousness, I loved that the characters felt so right and that they had some commonsense (GOD BLESS). I also really enjoyed that some serious themes were brought up and handled in a realistic way.But what I loved most was the overall positive writing. Yes, there is some teen drama, and you know what ? The grown-ups figures get involved! Because yes they should. In YA the parents/teachers are too often seen like ennemies, when really, yes, you should ask for their advice. And yes, the characters should call the police when they have to because DUH !And let me tell you about the positive body image! Once again, in YA, sex is often an issue, like it\\'s a forbidden or a dangerous thing, when IRL sex can be such an important part of our lives. So yes, YA authors should talk about positive sex, they should tell teens that sex can be a positive experience, that you don\\'t have to be ashamed of your or your partner\\'s naked body ! Needing and wanting is normal, it\\'s okay, and HUMAN BODS ARE BEAUTIFUL BABY. So, um, anyway.All these little things were really important to me and I had a great time reading this.

The more time that Bailey spends with Porter at work, she realizes that there is more to him then meets the eye and they both bear the scars of a tragic experience. I liked Porter because he was someone who was very protective of the people that he cared about and he was someone who was very special, if people took the time to actually get to know him.

       " [\"Don't get me wrong, Alex, Approximately is quite good but the reason for my 3 star rating is more to do with the fact that I expected a bit more. You see, when I read that it's pretty much You've Got Mail with teenagers, I was like, yes, gimmie! But though the plot was very close t one of my favourite 90's rom-coms, the vibe and feel of it didn't come close.Now, the main problem I have with the book is the fact that I didn't find feel the characters and Bailey, our main protagonist, wasn't believable enough. Like, she describes herself as someone who is a master of avoiding conflict, and people in general, but she doesn't feel like someone who is closed up. I would understand if she was closed up to everyone else and our other main character Porter is the only one who brings her out of her shell, but she is open to everyone. And it's a bit contradicting to what she tries to say about herself, which annoyed me.Porter (and don't start with me with the fact that both main characters have drink-related names because both names are pretty rare to begin with and having two of them in the same book.. feels a bit pretentious) is nice though. I liked the sort of bad boy facade which wasn't overly done, but there were moments where I would have liked more explanation and resolve in regards to his certain personality traits. Like, given Bailey's back story, I would have had different reactions to certain aspects of the plot.All in all, it is a very You've Got Mail situation but part of me that liked the movie, felt like the book didn't capture the essence of the movie.

Along the way Bailey gets a summer job at a museum where she meets new friends and her new \"arch nemesis,\" Porter. Little does she know, Porter is actually Alex. I love Bailey. She is a geeky, awkward, and introverted \"evader.\" During the whole story, instead of asking for more personal information from Alex, she evades any sort of confrontation by trying to find out who Alex is in real life on her own. I DID roll my eyes whenever she mentioned this, and I DID get annoyed when obvious clues that pointed to Alex being Porter came up. But I feel like this was part of her character. She also has a back story which may explain why she likes to avoid things. I also adored Porter. He\\'s a witty security guard and surfer who gets along with his family yet seems to have a bit of a temper when he is not happy with someone.

California churros definitely taste as good as Bailey makes them out to be!I guess because this book is a romance, Bailey and Alex were the only characters who were fully developed.

He is Porter\\'s former/friend who is all kinds of messed up with parents who don\\'t seem to care. I\\'m being picky but because I\\'m from California, the geography confused me! Sometimes I would think they lived in Northern California, but Coronado is in Southern California. The redwoods are also near the Santa Cruz Boardwalk (which is why I kept picturing this happening at the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk) while the Sequoias are more in the SoCal area. Big Sur is also way up in NorCal. I also don\\'t think it\\'s possible to just spend a day in San Francisco when you live in Coronado, but they could have left in the morning I suppose.

       " [\"If you guys are looking for a fun summer young adult read, look no further because Alex, Approximately might just be the right book for you.It follows a girl named Bailey who is a completely classics movie buff. She meets a boy nicknamed 'Alex' online on a movie forum and they share a lot of things in common. Alex wants her to travel to California because they are going to have this big movie festival during summer and there is a movie he wants her to see, plus because they click so much, he wants to meet her. When her mother's relationship ends up on the rocks with her current husband, Bailey feels like she has had enough drama and moves to California to live with her dad.It just happens that Alex, also lives in the same city as her dad.Bailey get's cold feet and never tells 'Alex' that she is in town in hopes of scoping out the boy first, in case he is a creepy old man, and with her past she has every right to be careful.Unfortunately the search for Alex hits home a lot closer than she thinks.Can I just say I absolutely loved and adored this book. As far as romances go, this is like one of my top five favorites of this year so far. I had so much fun with this, with Bailey and Porter. I adored them.When the two first meet at work, it's a bit rocky. Porter comes off like an ass and Bailey does not want to cower in front of him.In fact, right from the start he really pisses her off. The two end up arguing a lot, but when they don't fight, sparks fly and magic happens. It turns out, Porter actually really likes her.I just loved this I really did. I needed something light after reading a dark book and this helped a lot. Lately I've also been enjoying Young Adult Contemporary because I haven't read a lot of them. Plus, it helps with the Adult Romance rot I am currently feeling.Bailey and Porter were great together. Not only did I love their relationship. I enjoyed the positive family relationships as well as friendships that developed in this book.I absolutely adored how everything unfolded and that Porter is actually Alex and how the two clicked offline, without actually knowing who the two really are. (This is not a spoiler, it's in the blurb y'all)There wasn't much that I disliked about this book except for the part where Bailey felt a bit thick when it came to the big reveal. Porter kind of put the two and two together first and his reaction made me a bit grumpy, but I just couldn't understand how Bailey did not see the missing puzzle piece when everything was sitting in front of her. Honestly, she should have put the two together a lot more quickly.Also, the Davy storyline in this was a little rough and a bit weirdly unnecessary.Overall, this was a great read - currently top 5 romance favorites this year. It was well written, with a wonderful storyline, great characters, positive relationships with friends, family and between Bailey and Porter.I loved Porter, I really did. He really made the story for me.This review was originally posted on Night Owl Book Cafe\"],\n",

However, \"Alex, Approximately\" met and exceeded my expectations of finding something similar to Statistical Probability. I loved the setting of Alex, Approximately. I loved how complex the characters were. I loved how Bailey is an introvert, acknowledging her behavior and the struggle of trying to change. And I love how Porter is a typical, mouthy adolescent idiot with struggles of his own.

You need to read this book. You will love this book. I swear, every time I have any interaction whatsoever with Porter Roth, something always goes screwy. He\\'s an electrical outlet, and I\\'m the stupid toddler, always trying to poke around and stick my finger inside.There are so many movie references in ALEX, APPROXIMATELY that I don\\'t know where to start. But the easiest way to describe this book is basically the bare bones concept of You\\'ve Got Mail but for teens. Except it goes a little something like this : boy meets girl on film festival forum. Boy and girl talk online for months. Boy wants girl to come out to California and see a movie with him -- and, I mean, also visit her father who happens to live in the same town. Girl has avoidance issues and refuses to commit, also because of reasons. Girl decides to make an educated decision about boy without telling him and flies to California for the summer and try and track him down without him knowing. The hunt doesn\\'t go well. And then there\\'s also Porter.Being with Porter is crazy and exciting. And much like a great thriller film, I\\'m not sure who\\'s going to end up dead by the closing credits.Bailey, as stated in her own words, likes to avoid messy and awkward and potentially damaging and/or hurtful situations. She\\'s shy on the onset and generally prefers to avoid confrontations in any way possible. And can I just say how much I loved this girl. I loved her baggage, even though it broke my heart and was so real and man Bennett did a great job making this a thing without making it a thing, but I loved her growth more. I loved how she evolves, not only because of a boy, but because of a wonderful female-friendship (no catty ladies here!) and also for herself. Maybe Walt Whitman was right. We all really do contradict ourselves and contain multitudes.And then there\\'s Porter. I don\\'t think I have words for what this boy is. Other than brilliant and hilarious and snarky and hardcore and sweet and brilliant and wonderful and arg. \"You might want to look away if you\\'re sensitive to dynamite male bodies. I don\\'t want you swooning at the sight of raw surfer.\"Oh, and cocky. He\\'s that, too.\"You always go around sticking your hands down boys\\' clothes?\"\"When they\\'re full of baked goods.\"\"Tomorrow I\\'m coming to work with ten pounds of pastries in my pants.\"The hate-to-love trope isn\\'t getting old anytime soon but the bonus to this relationship is it actually seemed a little more enemies-to-friends-who-want-to-bang. Which reminds me. I would like to award the author a hundred points to Griffindor for all the sex positivity in this book. There\\'s nothing explicit or graphic in this book, as befitting as YA novel, but.. oh my god, there\\'s one moment between them, after the bonfire.. it\\'s not kissing, it\\'s not a hug, but considering it\\'s a whole lot of nothing it didn\\'t feel like a whole lot of nothing. Whew. Things were much simpler when we were archenemies.This book isn\\'t all movie quotes, mistaken identities, hidden identities, and churros, though. There\\'s some serious events, some violence, heavy tragic moments, uncertain moments, friendships and relationships that are real and messy and painful and awkward, and yet it all blends so wonderfully. ALEX, APPROXIMATELY might not be blow you out of the water amazing, or maybe it will blow you away, who is to say -- in my case I couldn\\'t pull myself away from this book even for a minute, to the point where I missed dinner and made the executive decision that I can live off words instead of food.

Although I can figure out how will the story turns out even before finished reading the summary..but the summary REALLY will spoil you if you have never read this kind of story before. And I regret myself after reading the whole summary of the book. So, I suggest dear people for not reading the summary.Briefly, this story is about Bailey , a film buff who has been messaging with an online friend ( Alex ) in California. Bailey then moves to California without telling Alex and trying to seek him there.But then, she also encounters Roth, who works at the same place as Bailey. Yeah..you can fill in the details.This reminds me a lot like Geekerella. It pretty much has the same plot , the same start of relationship. But, I can say that this book has better and realistic romance development/pace than geekerella. It makes me giggle and punching my pillows like a mad woman. I love both the mcs, and how their smart-ass comments live-up their relationship. I can truly feel and enjoy how both of them start to have feelings and sometimes , I even find myself getting nervous and my heart thumping like crazy. So, just saying that I really feel connected to the characters.Another thing that I like about this book is , there's no complicated confllict that mess up with my mind. I don't have to feel burden or worried about it, which is okay for me because I'm not in the mood for family conflict or anything. Sometimes, I just feel family conflict is annoying ..because members of family should tolerate to each other and dont give your shits to each others, is what I think. My suggestion is, if you are close and might have problems, try to settle down with your family nicely ( idk, never got in this situation ), and if you arent close, probably you are not really open up with them, so, just keep it to yourself and don't mess up with other family members ( this is what I do ). I mean..lol I dont know..this is what I thought, Im not a family therapist or something.And where are we again? oh. you must be wondering as why this is a 3 stars rating. I have a problem towards the ending where I find the hero is being such an ass. I kinda feel like he is being someone else or something. Or am I the only one who think like this?

The setting was really fun, I loved the secondary characters, Grace especially, with whom Bailey shared a very genuine friendship. Bailey herself was quite relatable, at least for me, with her tendency to avoid confrontation and her difficulty to trust. I did enjoy her relationship with Porter by itself, I think the correspondent thing in this case just didn\\'t add anything to the story. We barely saw Alex and Mink interact, and when they did it was nothing of true sustenance / it didn\\'t contribute to their relationship. For a book setting its plot around their online connection, that aspect of the story felt kind of underdeveloped.But hey, it\\'s a ya contemporary, it\\'s fluffy in all the right places, and it holds a+ swoon worthy lines.

       " ['\\nActual rating:\\n 2.5/5 stars rounded up to three.I\\'m not a fan of YA Contemporary books (YA Fantasy, on the other hand, is another story) but I didn\\'t think twice about picking up this book because I heard it was inspired by the movies - \"You\\'ve Got Mail\" and \"Shop Around the Corner.\" I\\'ve enjoyed both movies, not just for the unique concept (two people who know each other both online and in real life without realizing it -- however, in one relationship: they are close confidants, and in the other: they are arch-nemesis/rivals of a sort), but I also love the direction the movies took with that idea. I wish I\\'d known that this book is apparently very \"loosely\" inspired by the movies. And that the execution of the premise is a completely different take compared to the movies -- but somewhat standard compared to every other contemporary romance and RomCom. \\nPlot Summary:\\n Our MC, Bailey Rydell, moves to California to live with her father - to avoid the tension of living with her mother and her boyfriend. But moving there also means being in the same place as her online friend, \"Alex\": who knows her as \"Mink\", shares her love for movies but also is someone who is growing to be a close friend - or even more than a friend. But upon arriving, she gets a job at a museum and gets off on the wrong foot with a co-worker, Porter Roth. That relationship between them starts with that heated tension and eventually develops into something deeper as they get to know each other. But the thing is: Alex and Porter are the same guy. And neither Bailey nor Porter know that the other person is the one they\\'ve been talking to online for months. Now, did the book live up to all my expectations of fun and ironic situations that premise can offer?\\nThe Good:\\n Two wonderfully flawed characters, each with their own complexities and past issues, that form a close bond that is very well developed and written. So yes, I liked that Bailey had avoidance issues and had to work on herself to better her friendships/relationships - she\\'s very relatable and mature. And I loved her passion for classic films and movies in general - I was the same when I was a teenager. And Porter, with his ups and downs was also an interesting, fun, and multi-faceted character. \\n\\nMaybe Walt Whitman was right. We all really do contradict ourselves and contain multitudes. How do we even figure out who we really are?\\n\\nThey were both very likable characters with a well written romance. I loved how they could disagree but still get along - there was a lot to appreciate about the characters and their relationship.\\nThe Not-so-good:\\n To be honest, throughout most of the book, I was bored. I spent so long trying to get into it -- two weeks, I think -- but it just wasn\\'t what I was looking for. Here why:* I felt kind of cheated. That\\'s my fault for having expectations and comparing the book to the movies. The whole \"Alex\" issue/mystery quickly fades into the background. Not just that - I mean the online part of their relationship is barely existent, or rather we\\'re shown so very little of it. It doesn\\'t really offset or play into the characters\\' real one - it\\'s more a part of their past than the present. So, really, the whole concept of obliviously knowing one other as two different people - that irony or even the mystery of it - is barely explored. It\\'s not as relevant to the main plot as I thought it would be. * And even putting the Alex/Mink part of the story aside - Porter and Bailey lose that fire and conflict between them too quickly. I expected the tension and heated banter to last a bit longer. They were each other\\'s \"arch-nemesis\" for like 20% of the book and then they were starting to get along and the getting-to-know-you romance started happening. It was... well developed and (there was still strong chemistry and even banter - but the cute type) and all that -- but nothing special to keep me wondering or even caring enough. I wanted more of this:\\n\\nHe holds out the receiver to me. â\\x80\\x9cGo on, say something, superstar.â\\x80\\x9d I shake my head. Not happening. I donâ\\x80\\x99t like the spotlight. Now Iâ\\x80\\x99m regretting that I asked about the yellow button. He tries to coax me into taking it with that laid-back voice of his, but his eyes are 100 percent challenge, like this is some sort of contest, and heâ\\x80\\x99s trying to see whoâ\\x80\\x99ll break first. â\\x80\\x9cCome on. Donâ\\x80\\x99t get shy on me now, glamour girl.â\\x80\\x9d Again with the catty nicknames? What is his problem? Well, he can forget it. Now itâ\\x80\\x99s a matter of principle. I cross my arms over my chest. â\\x80\\x9cNo.â\\x80\\x9d \"Itâ\\x80\\x99s just a little-bitty intercom,â\\x80\\x9d he says, wiggling the receiver in front of me. I shove his hand away.

You are Mink! Hear you roar! @mink: *cough* *sputter* *broken meow* @alex: Chin up. Youâ\\x80\\x99ll best this loser. Boys are dumb.\\nThe book was great at the start with moments like that but then the plot shifted mainly to Porter and Bailey\\'s growing relationship (date one, date two, misadventures and life occurences, special moments here and there...)... I started getting restless for something to happen at some point. I kept wondering when the \"Alex\" twist would come back and put a spark back in the book! ((It did but late enough that I stopped caring - and the way it happened made me lose even more interest)).* But wait, let\\'s not forget we have an antagonist in the story for that; Porter\\'s ex-best friend, Davey - who has a bad drug addiction and criminal record, and who once went behind Porter\\'s back with an ex-girlfriend, and now has his mind set on harassing Porter and Bailey... I mean... Was that needed? The original plot/twist would be interesting enough if it was used more prominently - it wouldn\\'t have needed a Davey to shake things up for Porter and Bailey!And I understand that the author meant to show that knowing a person for all they are needs getting to know each other deeply and personally - learning all sides to a person. But if that\\'s the message of the book then it made for a good depiction of a well developed romantic relationship - using the online/offline concept in the background to further its point. But if you\\'re looking for a fun romantic story that takes this concept (of dual identities) and cleverly plays with the possibilities it presents (like I was hoping for) - then watch \"You\\'ve Got Mail\" or \"Shop Around the Corner\" instead. Because this book is not like those movies in that way. It simply turned out to be a regular Contemporary Romance. But if you like Contemporary Romances - or if you like those but avoid the YA genre - then give this a try, because it\\'s a well-written one with a mature romance and complex characters.I just usually prefer when there\\'s a bit of a twist or something beyond the normal to make the story more compelling. That\\'s why I should stick more to Fantasy, Sci-fi, or even Mysteries, and take another break from contemporaries. So maybe my lack of enthusiasm for this book is more of a \"it\\'s me, not you\" situation.'],\n",

The California setting and beach-y town atmosphere was just so easy to visualize and it felt like you were actually there. I really loved the main character, Bailey, because she's so rational and mature, especially in her relationship with Porter (who is a great love interest by the way). Speaking of relationships, I love the hate-to-love relationship in this one. Their chemistry is through the roof and I also liked that they formed a friendship (unknowingly) through a common interest in old films. Something else I really like was that Grace, Bailey's best friend, and Porter, brought some diversity into this novel, specifically their culture and the food they eat. It added a really nice feel to the book and I'm glad Jenn incorporated it. This book was just so addicting and I couldn't put it down.

Swoon overload!!!Aside from the incredible romance, there was so much more to this book to love. The friendship between Bailey and the friend she meets in California, Grace, was so fun to watch evolve. I also fully enjoyed the relationship Bailey had with her father. Though they struggled at times to see eye-to-eye, he was very much involved in her life and they, together, worked out their issues. He was a fantastic father that always had his daughter\\'s back. I loved it! Also worth mentioning was the great bond between Porter and his family. I adored his mother and they way she brought their very busy family together as a team.

Bailey\\'s having to work in the \"hot box\" and sweat all day, the incredibly old-school security system, the silly-named rooms...

It felt a little bit out of place, and in all honesty I felt like it served no purpose other than to describe why the main character was scared of guns.Um, because theyâ\\x80\\x99re guns. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s why.But really, that and a couple of the dramatic side plots couldâ\\x80\\x99ve been cut out and the book may have been better for it. Honestly, I was sort of on the fence about it. Which is why I rated this book lower than five stars on GoodReads. Still though, it was a very enjoyable read.'],\n",

I did enjoy myself for most of the novel, there were so many cringe-worthy moments that you couldn't help but die of laughter about, and I liked a lot of the dialogue and the witty banter between the two mains. I understood the arc that Bailey was meant to go through, but it felt a bit as though, all of a sudden, she realized the error of her ways and decided to stop evading conflict because the plot told her to. Porter was just really, really generic for me. At first, I thought that maybe he would have a little more depth, but he really ended up being as shallow as a kiddy pool. Not to mention the fact that the pacing of this book was thrown off so much by this need to have these romantic scenes, and so the last chapter ended up being really unsettling for me. If Overall, though, I think this is a good book to get you out of a reading slump.\"],\n",

I LOVE that ugly green sweater you got me for Christmas Uncle Jimmy!\" kind of nice). I took off one star because I wasn\\'t upset and left wanting more once the book ended. I often get that feeling in really good books, but after this one ended I said, \"okay, next book.\"I deducted the second star because while I enjoyed the pretense of the book and the storyline of the book, I don\\'t feel the description matches up with the story line. The conversations between Mink and Alex are minimal and don\\'t quite feel like a big portion of the story (i.e. Cindy Ella or Cinder & Ella (wow I have a thing for Cinderella stories) or even P.S. I Like You (there, a non Cinderella one!)). I admit I was disappointed because (as you can tell), I do enjoy a good \"I hate you, but I secretly love your messages so now I love you\" book!Other than that I would say the story is good.

I'm generally a high fantasy kind of girl so when I came across this book the other day as I was killing time waiting on a prescription to be filled, I hesitated to even pick it up. Why waste my money on a book I was sure would be added to the dusty pile of DNF books? But there was just something that pulled me back and good God am I glad I went with that feeling.This book is magic. The story is magic. The characters are familiar and relatable. There is drama, there is angst, there is humor, and there is most definitely a hell of a romance. The Romance is the hate to love, slow burn sort. No insta-love bullshit. And they aren't perfect snowflake people either. That's one reason this book works so well. You've got two people that are very clearly flawed and I love that. I could write a lot more about this but it's one of those books that I think you should just dive into blindly.

I mean it had everything a good summer read can haveâ\\x80\\x94talks about good taste in movies, gives off a fifties vibe, has eclectic characters working inside a cave museum, and includes surfing dudes who are far too charming and intellectual for their own good. This book was just the right one at the right day with the right weather, and it was more than enough for me to obsess over. It was so simple yet it was totally a breath of fresh air. Alex, Approximately had all the right pieces enough to charm the pants out of me.\\n\"Listen to me, okay? Whatâ\\x80\\x99s between us? This is the best thing thatâ\\x80\\x99s ever happened to me in my entire life, and I donâ\\x80\\x99t want it to end.

And that scares the hell out of me. So thatâ\\x80\\x99s why I tell you things about me, because I figure if I weigh you down with my baggage, then youâ\\x80\\x99ll be less likely to run.\"\\n Bailey was such a character! I loved her intelligence, her sense of style, her Lana Turner hair, and even her adorable awkwardness. I seriously want to be friends with her in real life. The book was told perfectly through her voice and thoughts. The issues she\\'s been going through, while being the Artful Dodger she is, was fun to witness. I just loved seeing her develop as a character. Of course, having Porter by her side...well, that\\'s a different story. A story I\\'ve come to love much better.\\nIâ\\x80\\x99m trying-trying-trying not to breathe so fast. But Porter shifts, and the hand that isnâ\\x80\\x99t trapping me falls to the side. His fingers dance over my hand, a gossamer touch, and he traces soft patterns on my open palm, Morse code taps, gently urging, send a thousand electric currents of signals up my nerves.â\\x80\\x9cWhy?â\\x80\\x9d he whispers against my cheek.I whimper.He knows heâ\\x80\\x99s won.

His head drops to the crook of my neck and rests there. The fingers that were teasing me with their little tap-tap-tapping messages now curl around my fingers, loosely clasping. And the arm pinning me to the mailbox is now lifting away, and I feel his hand smooth down the length of my hair.\\n Porter, Porter, Porter. This boy. I swear. There are so many layers with this boy, but it feels like you\\'ll never get tired in discovering each one. Porter was so easy to love. Aggressive at first, but damn if that doesn\\'t just make him more charming than he already is. He was such a sweetheart, and his lowkey intelligence is just outright sexy. I should feel so attacked with his amazingness. I am in awe of Porter. What I\\'d do to spend a day with Porter. *sigh* Porter is love, Porter is life, everybody!\\nThe bar comes down, trapping us together. Arm against arm. Leg against leg, flesh against flesh. My heart beats against my rib cage as if itâ\\x80\\x99s excitedly keeping time with a song. Every once in a while, I feel his eyes on my face, but I donâ\\x80\\x99t dare look back. We ride in silence the entire way down, watching the town get bigger and bigger.A couple of yards before we hit the ground, he speaks up in a voice so quiet, I can barely hear him. â\\x80\\x9cWhat I said the other day about you having champagne tastes?â\\x80\\x9d He pauses for a moment. Mr. Reyes is smiling, waiting to unhitch our bar. â\\x80\\x9cI just wanted you to know that I like the way you dress. I like your style. . . .

It was absolutely perfect until the very last page! 5 stars!\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDoes this hurt?â\\x80\\x9d I ask, lightly dabbing antibiotic ointment on his wound.

Porter was an immediate love for me. He was so confident, silly, and aggravatingly sarcastic. I lit up when it came to the banter between him and Bailey. I loved how he didn\\'t give her an inch and was constantly being playful and all in-her-face. The beginning of their relationship started off with Bailey hating on Porter hardcore, getting annoyed at everything he did... and this just made me love him even more!! Hate-to-love romances are some of my faves, and this was no exception. What a fun relationship these two developed! Swoon overload!!!Aside from the incredible romance, there was so much more to this book to love. The friendship between Bailey and the friend she meets in California, Grace, was so fun to watch evolve. I also fully enjoyed the relationship Bailey had with her father. Though they struggled at times to see eye-to-eye, he was very much involved in her life and they, together, worked out their issues. He was a fantastic father that always had his daughter\\'s back. I loved it! Also worth mentioning was the great bond between Porter and his family. I adored his mother and they way she brought their very busy family together as a team. The support and loyalty the families showed each and every member was very refreshing and a joy to find in a YA book.Let me mention the settings in this book as well, since they\\'re ah-mazing! First, we have a beach setting. I mean, seriously... boardwalks, sunshine, surfing... how can you not love it! When I was a teenager I always dreamed of spending a summer in a place like this. How incredible! Add to that the fun museum setting and WOW! I loved how the museum was completely brought to life, flaws and all. Bailey\\'s having to work in the \"hot box\" and sweat all day, the incredibly old-school security system, the silly-named rooms... Jenn Bennett knows how to make you feel connected to every single person, place and thing in her stories.Welp, Jenn Bennett did it again!!! She completely blew me away with \\nThe Anatomical Shape of a Heart\\n last year, and Jack has been my book boyfriend since I first met him. And guys, here comes Porter, now sitting at the very tippity top of my BBF list right along side him!! â\\x99¥ Relatable characters that are so real they are impossible not to connect with, a romance that\\'s so fun, silly and swoony you\\'ll fall hard, and a storyline that is unputdownable from beginning to end, this is a real gem. If you love adorableness, topped with all the swooning, and a side of emotions, this is a must-read for you!\\n(Thanks to Simon Pulse for the review copy!)Find this review and others like it at Lost in Literature!\\n\\n\\n']]"

       " 'Overall, I thought Alex, Approximately was a cute and sweet quick read. Perfect for the beach! :)However, there were a few things that bothered me about this novel:- I, unfortunately, can\\'t help but compare this to Things We Know By Heart, which is insanely similar to this novel. I mean, the concept isn\\'t anything new, but the similarities between the novels: wow. Ultimately, I liked both novels about the same, but (view spoiler)[ one thing the Things We Know By Heart gets right is the fact that one of the main characters knows the truth throughout the whole novel. Even in You\\'ve Got Mail, Tom Hanks knows pretty quickly who exactly Meg Ryan is.

He doesn\\'t come off very likable in the first couple of chapters and then those actions don\\'t really mesh with the person he turns out to be in the rest of the novel. It\\'s like the author was trying to create this witty banter between them (a sort of love/hate situation) and instead Porter is just flat out MEAN. I really didn\\'t understand that.- Eye-rolling Subplot/Scenes: The whole subplot with Davy made me roll my eyes. It wasn\\'t necessary. at. all. (view spoiler)[ I also found the \"steamy\" scenes to be cringeworthy at various points. There is an art to writing romantic scenes, especially in a YA novel, and some of them in the book were just not good.  (hide spoiler)]- Lastly (and totally minor), the cover! I love the artwork, but in no way doesn\\'t it have anything do with the book other than it looks like they might be watching a movie. Why is there a pool? This book takes place at the beach?!? I just don\\'t get it!Overall, I\\'ll give this novel 3 stars because there were just too many minor things that bothered me about this book.

When I began this book, the premise sounded great and I expected something saturated in cheese and possibly overly sweet...I wasn\\'t quite sure. But it ended up actually having some really heavy elements to it, and the writing was so smart and well done and the romance part is definitely not too sweet- it\\'s a bit more advanced but the characters are older so I thought it was a good fit. The dialogue is great and the characters have great depth. But back to the writing- so good! Her metaphors are unique and not overwrought. I did think that the words \"Artful Dodger\" were used way too much in about the first 30% of the book. That got toned down in the rest though, so it didn\\'t end up being annoying. As I was reading this, I was saying to myself \"I will now read anything Jenn Bennett has ever written,\" stupidly not realizing that she wrote Night Owls which I have on my shelf and will be reading next.

I laughed out loud (literally) multiple times, especially \"she has the strength of a tater tot\"-The premise really drew me in, as You\\'ve Got Mail is probably one of my favorite rom-coms ever-Although this is a contemporary novel, the world-building was excellent, something not normally seen in this genre.-Bennett dives further into more graphic and adult topics while still keeping it light-hearted and fun and one does not detract from the other-Bailey wants to be a curator!! Yay job representation!!The Not So Good:-The \\'miscommunication\\'/\\'misunderstanding\\' trope is rife in this novel, which I particularly find immensely frustrating-Bailey and Porter\\'s relationship can be wishy-washy at times, they\\'ll be happy one minute and arguing (not bantering, there\\'s a difference) the next. While I understand Bennett was utilizing the \\'hate to love\\' trope, there\\'s a sharp contrast between playful banter, which they have a lot, to yelling at one another at the drop of a hat.Would I Recommend It?Absolutely! While I did have some problems with the book, it\\'s a great summer read filled with laughter and fun yet still keeping an edge. However, I wish the publishers didn\\'t market it as a \"You\\'ve Got Mail for teens\", because it\\'s really not. I can see how it has elements of the main plot of the film in it, but the online chat forum turns out to be only a minuscule point in Alex, Approximately. I could have been overly disappointed in the plot because I know the source material like the back of my hand, but don\\'t market your book to be something it isn\\'t. (Also watch the film it\\'s 11/10)Rating:4/5; B-Favorite Quote:Truthfully, the tater tot one is, but here\\'s my second favorite:\"But just when you think you understand someone, it turns out that you didn\\'t know them at all.

I mean, you can kind of predict how the book will end, but it's a matter of how it gets there that made it worthwhile.The main female character is Bailey Rydell (and every time I read her last name, I though of Rydell High from Grease). She starts her summer by moving across the country to live with her dad. I love how carefree she is and admits that she's a flawed person. She deals with a lot in regards to her family life, but she's trying to make herself better by admitting that she has faults. She's a very likeable person.Her father arranges for her to have a summer job at a nearby museum. She immediately clicks with another teenage girl, and the two become close. Throw in Porter, who is a member of a well-known area family due to his family's success in surfing. He is a completely likeable person from the very beginning, as he's charming and flirty without being overly cocky. I absolutely loved the banter between Baily and Porter.In the mix of all of this is a man named Alex who Bailey has been communicating with via a chat forum. Coincidently, Alex lives in the same town as her father, and Bailey struggles with letting Alex know she's in town vs. slowly developing feelings for Porter.The chemistry between Bailey and Porter was so sweet and swoon-worthy. I couldn't get enough of the two of them and was silently rooting them on. It was a refreshing, fun read and I was sad to finish it so quickly.

I loved the relationship between the main character, Bailey, and her dad. The romance part was pretty good, although it did seem like Bailey and \"Alex\" had very little chemistry that we got to see. My favorite thing about this book was the way it handled sexuality. It was a very honest look at teenagers and sex and didn\\'t try to sugarcoat it or skip over it. When I was a teenager, I never read a book that talked about masturbation, even though every single teenager does it. Overall it is an engaging read. ',\n",

And i liked the fact that Bennett didn't shush the sex but still didn't make it too cringy.

I guess I wished the book would either really lean into fluff or angst, and instead it just tiptoed around both in a way that was kind of unsatisfying. Like there was a decent amount of trauma and background for the different characters that felt... really superficial. Also some storylines felt superfluous and unresolved. (view spoiler)[i.e. Davy and the missing mom. I was pretty disturbed by the lack of communication from the mom completely. (hide spoiler)] Learning that Jenn Bennet has a background as a romance writer explains A LOT about how I felt about the plot and background though. I did really like how there was an emphasis on different cultures, such as Porter was Hawaiian and Grace was Nigerian (Grace was also tragically underused and underdeveloped.) The movie obsession was cute, but it also made me laugh because the characters felt so genuinely like teenagers in that moment. Like they talk about a lot of really famous movies, yet Bailey and Porter seemed surprised the other knew the films. I think I was a bit hesitant because You've Got Mail is one of my favorite films and some of the charm of that movie was missing here. About halfway into the book, it really seems like the online flirtation didn't matter anymore, so towards the end when Bailey feels torn didn't quite have the emotional satisfaction I could've hoped for. (The story behind her nickname was very cute). Also by making Bailey's family paranoid of using social media and thus her reason for the ~secrecy~ of talking to a strange online kind of felt like a cop out instead of finding a way to adapt the You've Got Mail storyline into a modern setting.\",\n",

The female lead isn\\'t perfect or overly \"adorkable.\" She had flaws, and a wide range of interests that seem natural instead of an author trying to give a character dimension. The love interest has multiple jobs, a personality, and seems well matched. There were no points where I wanted to shake my head and wonder why the author was forcing something that wasn\\'t working. I just didn\\'t overly care what happened. When you read cute stories meant to be read at a beach, there are two rules: Don\\'t drag it out, and make it addictive. I just read it because it wasn\\'t bad enough to make it an DNF, but I was sort of disappointed. That said, the movie quotes were fun, and the supporting characters meant something to the plot.

However, that all changed after The Reveal. Then, I thought he was an utter a**hat, a real hypocrite with all his fine talk about truth and honesty, and then essentially treats Bailey like something that needs to be scraped off the bottom of his shoe.When he realizes that Bailey never â\\x80\\x9cplayedâ\\x80\\x9d him or his online persona of Alex, then he relents and magnanimously deigns to talk to her, but even then, he offhandedly portrays blowing her off as some misunderstanding, rather than tell her the truth. To her credit, Bailey doesnâ\\x80\\x99t immediately relent; she is rightfully still hurt and confused and wonâ\\x80\\x99t do the kiss and makeup that Porter wants until she gets some answers. Good on her!But, as to that, Bailey has fairly consistently shown backbone throughout the novel, beginning with tackling the would-be Maltese Falcon thieves, all the way to her epic meltdown in the HotBox. Thus, I felt the author did a disservice to the character by labeling her the Artful Dodger time and again in the book. We readers see very little of that.Frankly, I thought the novel should have dealt a lot more with Baileyâ\\x80\\x99s PTSD concerning the incident with Greg. One gets the sense that even with all the therapy she underwent, there were still unresolved issues and feelings stemming from The Incident. And a major part of the unresolved issue involves Baileyâ\\x80\\x99s mom. Itâ\\x80\\x99s so unreal that her mom basically chose not to contact Bailey all summer! Yes, so they never had an exceptionally close mother-daughter bond in the first place, but the mom character comes across as a narcissistic, unfeeling, person â\\x80\\x93 someone who was the true Artful Dodger of the story. The pace of the story was slow. Because the story was fairly unoriginal (itâ\\x80\\x99s basically â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99ve Got Mailâ\\x80\\x9d but set in the YA milieu), the characters, pacing and narrative needed to elevate the plot, but alas, that was not to be.I thought Grace, Baileyâ\\x80\\x99s BFF was the best character in this book. She was fun, spunky and heck, who doesnâ\\x80\\x99t love a British accent?As for the best part of the book for me? It was the inclusion of a Star Wars quote.

For me, this is what a perfect escapist read is: good writing, good story, minor issues and a tidy little ending. I use these kind of stories for palate cleansers in between heavier books and for days where I donâ\\x80\\x99t want to be disturbed or sad (birthdays, holidays, vacation). So when I read about Alex, Approximately in several review journals, where it received lots of good reviews, I mentally filed it away for a day that I would need it.That day, it turned out, was this past Saturday, during my Birthday weekend. It was a warm and sunny day, one of the few weâ\\x80\\x99ve had this season, and I just wanted to relax on the porch with a book. Alex, Approximately, turned out to be the icing on this relaxing cake of a day. Described as a kind of YA version of You Got Mail, this delightful teenage romp follows 17-year old Bailey â\\x80\\x9cMinkâ\\x80\\x9d Rydell, as she moves across the country to live with her Dad in an idyllic California coastal town. Bailey is a classic movie buff and has made online friends with a fellow movie buff named â\\x80\\x9cAlex,â\\x80\\x9d who also happens to live in this idyllic coastal town. Unsure whether she is ready to tell this online person that she has moved close by, the guarded and (literally, it turns out) gunshy Bailey decides to scope him out in person before revealing herself as his online friend. He could be a creep for all she knows! As you can imagine, hijinx ensue as Bailey quickly falls for her cocky, handsome surfer boy coworker. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll let you fill in the Youâ\\x80\\x99ve Got Mail parallels for yourself.I fully expected the usual romantic comedy plot line of meet cute, misunderstanding/breakup, resolution/reunion. While some of the usual tropes exist in this sweet story, it features an edge and a depth that I didnâ\\x80\\x99t expect. Both Bailey and her love interest have a traumatic experience in their past that keeps them from being completely straight forward with each other and others. And a troubled local teen with a serious drug problem frequently shows up to bring real menace to their otherwise idyllic life. Still, Bennett has written an entirely pleasurable story that will keep you interested, invested and most importantly, distracted.

She acts really weirdly around him, doesn\\'t answer his questions, and because of one comment he makes -- she becomes determined to hate him. Bailey\\'s whole attitude toward Porter in the beginning made me skim through the first few chapters because she hates him with so little justification. It\\'s really unclear why he likes her at all, besides the fact that she\\'s supposed to be hot.2) Bailey in the beginning makes a big deal about how she\\'s a serial evader and doesn\\'t like engaging in situations she\\'s uncomfortable with.

First of all, it\\'s ridiculous that Bailey is this dense about P = A, to the extent that she never even considers Porter to be a candidate for Alex. That\\'s a big plot hole IMO. But my real problem is that when Porter finds out about \"Mink\", he DOES THE CLASSIC MOVIE TROPE THING of walking away and stretching out a problem for multiple chapters when it could be resolved if the two of them just talked to each other. Immediately before that happened, Porter had asked Bailey to promise to not keep secrets from him. But as soon as he found out the book\\'s secret, HE kept it from HER, and was really upset that she wouldn\\'t come clean about it even though HE WASN\\'T EITHER.

First of all, it\\'s ridiculous that Bailey is this dense about P = A, to the extent that she never even considers Porter to be a candidate for Alex. That\\'s a big plot hole IMO. But my real problem is that when Porter finds out about \"Mink\", he DOES THE CLASSIC MOVIE TROPE THING of walking away and stretching out a problem for multiple chapters when it could be resolved if the two of them just talked to each other. Immediately before that happened, Porter had asked Bailey to promise to not keep secrets from him.

Of course with the 20 year difference between this beloved movie & it\\'s inspiration, The Shop Around the Corner, times have changed as has technology. No longer is it the AOL tones of  You\\'ve Got Mail , now it\\'s private chat messages through a Film Website.We have Bailey & Porter, who are some of the most real characters that also fit my beauitul YGM story. Bailey is so real, between her anxiety & \"Artful Dodger\" side/wall that she knows she retreats behind. She has such a great character arc throughout the story that you just love it.Her anxiety is believable as are her walls and her slowly letting them down for Grace & Porter.Porter is everything you want in a sassy but caring Main Beau. Plus he\\'s a surfer,so you already know he\\'s in shape and probably Too Hot Hot Damn, which he knows because he even owns a \\'Hot Stuff\\' Jacket.Their love of movies is great, but it would have been over the moon if the inspiration had been referenced at all in the story. You see them grow and become closer even besides their love of movies.Alex, Approximately is the perfect summer movie for those who love YA Contemporaries. IT has such a great story that is believable and is just up my alley. I would recommend this story to anyone who loves either The Shop Around the Corner or You\\'ve Got Mail, or surfers, or old timey movies.',\n",

I also really enjoyed that some serious themes were brought up and handled in a realistic way.But what I loved most was the overall positive writing. Yes, there is some teen drama, and you know what ? The grown-ups figures get involved! Because yes they should. In YA the parents/teachers are too often seen like ennemies, when really, yes, you should ask for their advice. And yes, the characters should call the police when they have to because DUH !And let me tell you about the positive body image! Once again, in YA, sex is often an issue, like it\\'s a forbidden or a dangerous thing, when IRL sex can be such an important part of our lives. So yes, YA authors should talk about positive sex, they should tell teens that sex can be a positive experience, that you don\\'t have to be ashamed of your or your partner\\'s naked body ! Needing and wanting is normal, it\\'s okay, and HUMAN BODS ARE BEAUTIFUL BABY. So, um, anyway.All these little things were really important to me and I had a great time reading this.

The more time that Bailey spends with Porter at work, she realizes that there is more to him then meets the eye and they both bear the scars of a tragic experience. I liked Porter because he was someone who was very protective of the people that he cared about and he was someone who was very special, if people took the time to actually get to know him. I figured out his true identity in the beginning of this story and I was very glad that we got to know Porter just like Bailey did.I also liked Bailey from the very beginning.

It should be noted that the setting is more interesting than the characters and their stories: a lavish mansion turned museum built atop a network of caves wherein a married couple found a cache of hidden treasure (from whence it came is never disclosed), which started years of high life that ultimately lead to their grisly demise in a bitter murder-suicide. Alex, Approximately is amiable enough, but I want to read that book.\",\n",
       " \"Don't get me wrong, Alex, Approximately is quite good but the reason for my 3 star rating is more to do with the fact that I expected a bit more. You see, when I read that it's pretty much You've Got Mail with teenagers, I was like, yes, gimmie! But though the plot was very close t one of my favourite 90's rom-coms, the vibe and feel of it didn't come close.Now, the main problem I have with the book is the fact that I didn't find feel the characters and Bailey, our main protagonist, wasn't believable enough. Like, she describes herself as someone who is a master of avoiding conflict, and people in general, but she doesn't feel like someone who is closed up. I would understand if she was closed up to everyone else and our other main character Porter is the only one who brings her out of her shell, but she is open to everyone. And it's a bit contradicting to what she tries to say about herself, which annoyed me.Porter (and don't start with me with the fact that both main characters have drink-related names because both names are pretty rare to begin with and having two of them in the same book.. feels a bit pretentious) is nice though. I liked the sort of bad boy facade which wasn't overly done, but there were moments where I would have liked more explanation and resolve in regards to his certain personality traits. Like, given Bailey's back story, I would have had different reactions to certain aspects of the plot.All in all, it is a very You've Got Mail situation but part of me that liked the movie, felt like the book didn't capture the essence of the movie. And a certain aspect, that I can't reveal because of spoilers, was missing from the book, which is fine, because not every story has to be the same, but I sort of wanted that to happen..

The town is also in California and hey! I\\'m from there, too! This book was a light read and totally adorable, but I kept thinking, \"Man, I would have LOVED this book in high school!\" I think I might always think this way whenever I read a YA contemporary though...Bailey aka \"Mink\" lives on the East Coast of the U.S. with her mother. She joins an online movie group and keeps in touch (and kind of crushes on) a boy on the West Coast named \"Alex.\" Bailey\\'s mother and boyfriend start fighting too much for Bailey\\'s liking so she decides to move in with her father on the West Coast to evade the situation. She ends up living in the same town as Alex but wants to do some investigating of her own to make sure Alex is who he says he is. Along the way Bailey gets a summer job at a museum where she meets new friends and her new \"arch nemesis,\" Porter. Little does she know, Porter is actually Alex. I love Bailey. She is a geeky, awkward, and introverted \"evader.\" During the whole story, instead of asking for more personal information from Alex, she evades any sort of confrontation by trying to find out who Alex is in real life on her own. I DID roll my eyes whenever she mentioned this, and I DID get annoyed when obvious clues that pointed to Alex being Porter came up. But I feel like this was part of her character. She also has a back story which may explain why she likes to avoid things. I also adored Porter. He\\'s a witty security guard and surfer who gets along with his family yet seems to have a bit of a temper when he is not happy with someone. I also liked that this book was set mostly near a boardwalk and a museum in California. I kind of pictured this being at the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk because of the mention of the redwood trees. California churros definitely taste as good as Bailey makes them out to be!I guess because this book is a romance, Bailey and Alex were the only characters who were fully developed. I would have liked to know more about Bailey\\'s mother, Porter\\'s father, Grace, and Davy. Especially Davy. He is Porter\\'s former/friend who is all kinds of messed up with parents who don\\'t seem to care. I\\'m being picky but because I\\'m from California, the geography confused me! Sometimes I would think they lived in Northern California, but Coronado is in Southern California. The redwoods are also near the Santa Cruz Boardwalk (which is why I kept picturing this happening at the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk) while the Sequoias are more in the SoCal area. Big Sur is also way up in NorCal. I also don\\'t think it\\'s possible to just spend a day in San Francisco when you live in Coronado, but they could have left in the morning I suppose. California is a huge state!I recommend this book to anyone who wants a cute light read and loves a great classic film!',\n",

Sheâ\\x80\\x99s talked to him every day for months and months, but itâ\\x80\\x99s always through the messenger system of her favorite movie fan chatboard site and itâ\\x80\\x99s always kept anonymous. She doesnâ\\x80\\x99t even know his real name. But, as chance would have, she does know that he lives in the same California surfer town as her father. And she just so happens to be moving there at the start of summer. Not that sheâ\\x80\\x99ll tell Alex yet, despite how desperate he seems to want to meet her in person. Instead, sheâ\\x80\\x99s going to take the summer to try to figure out his real identity, to determine if heâ\\x80\\x99s, you know, old or a creep or something. That is, of course, until she meets Porter Roth, member of a prominent surfing family, the owner of beautiful curls, her coworker, and, perhaps, her least favorite person.

I definitely wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t look to it as a paragon of well-written literature, but it was much better quality than a lot of YA contemporary fluff. Baileyâ\\x80\\x99s character was pretty well-done. Her obsession with all things vintage and â\\x80\\x9chaving styleâ\\x80\\x9d may have made me roll my eyes a bit, but it did fit with her character. I especially appreciate that though she is introverted and prefers to be alone, sheâ\\x80\\x99s not shy. Itâ\\x80\\x99s refreshing to see that those two qualities arenâ\\x80\\x99t necessarily mutually inclusive. Porter was swoony of course and was my favorite character.

Besides the sweet characters and the predictable but lovely plot, this book also touched on some important issues. Porter and Bailey both had some pretty dark stuff in their past and thatâ\\x80\\x99s definitely shaped who theyâ\\x80\\x99ve become.Anyway, cute summer book.

She meets a boy nicknamed 'Alex' online on a movie forum and they share a lot of things in common. Alex wants her to travel to California because they are going to have this big movie festival during summer and there is a movie he wants her to see, plus because they click so much, he wants to meet her. When her mother's relationship ends up on the rocks with her current husband, Bailey feels like she has had enough drama and moves to California to live with her dad.It just happens that Alex, also lives in the same city as her dad.Bailey get's cold feet and never tells 'Alex' that she is in town in hopes of scoping out the boy first, in case he is a creepy old man, and with her past she has every right to be careful.Unfortunately the search for Alex hits home a lot closer than she thinks.Can I just say I absolutely loved and adored this book. As far as romances go, this is like one of my top five favorites of this year so far. I had so much fun with this, with Bailey and Porter. I adored them.When the two first meet at work, it's a bit rocky. Porter comes off like an ass and Bailey does not want to cower in front of him.In fact, right from the start he really pisses her off. The two end up arguing a lot, but when they don't fight, sparks fly and magic happens. It turns out, Porter actually really likes her.I just loved this I really did. I needed something light after reading a dark book and this helped a lot. Lately I've also been enjoying Young Adult Contemporary because I haven't read a lot of them. Plus, it helps with the Adult Romance rot I am currently feeling.Bailey and Porter were great together. Not only did I love their relationship. I enjoyed the positive family relationships as well as friendships that developed in this book.I absolutely adored how everything unfolded and that Porter is actually Alex and how the two clicked offline, without actually knowing who the two really are. (This is not a spoiler, it's in the blurb y'all)There wasn't much that I disliked about this book except for the part where Bailey felt a bit thick when it came to the big reveal. Porter kind of put the two and two together first and his reaction made me a bit grumpy, but I just couldn't understand how Bailey did not see the missing puzzle piece when everything was sitting in front of her. Honestly, she should have put the two together a lot more quickly.Also, the Davy storyline in this was a little rough and a bit weirdly unnecessary.Overall, this was a great read - currently top 5 romance favorites this year. It was well written, with a wonderful storyline, great characters, positive relationships with friends, family and between Bailey and Porter.I loved Porter, I really did. He really made the story for me.This review was originally posted on Night Owl Book Cafe\",\n",

You need to read this book. You will love this book. I swear, every time I have any interaction whatsoever with Porter Roth, something always goes screwy. He\\'s an electrical outlet, and I\\'m the stupid toddler, always trying to poke around and stick my finger inside.There are so many movie references in ALEX, APPROXIMATELY that I don\\'t know where to start. But the easiest way to describe this book is basically the bare bones concept of You\\'ve Got Mail but for teens. Except it goes a little something like this : boy meets girl on film festival forum. Boy and girl talk online for months. Boy wants girl to come out to California and see a movie with him -- and, I mean, also visit her father who happens to live in the same town. Girl has avoidance issues and refuses to commit, also because of reasons. Girl decides to make an educated decision about boy without telling him and flies to California for the summer and try and track him down without him knowing. The hunt doesn\\'t go well. And then there\\'s also Porter.Being with Porter is crazy and exciting. And much like a great thriller film, I\\'m not sure who\\'s going to end up dead by the closing credits.Bailey, as stated in her own words, likes to avoid messy and awkward and potentially damaging and/or hurtful situations. She\\'s shy on the onset and generally prefers to avoid confrontations in any way possible. And can I just say how much I loved this girl. I loved her baggage, even though it broke my heart and was so real and man Bennett did a great job making this a thing without making it a thing, but I loved her growth more. I loved how she evolves, not only because of a boy, but because of a wonderful female-friendship (no catty ladies here!) and also for herself. Maybe Walt Whitman was right. We all really do contradict ourselves and contain multitudes.And then there\\'s Porter. I don\\'t think I have words for what this boy is. Other than brilliant and hilarious and snarky and hardcore and sweet and brilliant and wonderful and arg. \"You might want to look away if you\\'re sensitive to dynamite male bodies. I don\\'t want you swooning at the sight of raw surfer.\"Oh, and cocky. He\\'s that, too.\"You always go around sticking your hands down boys\\' clothes?\"\"When they\\'re full of baked goods.\"\"Tomorrow I\\'m coming to work with ten pounds of pastries in my pants.\"The hate-to-love trope isn\\'t getting old anytime soon but the bonus to this relationship is it actually seemed a little more enemies-to-friends-who-want-to-bang. Which reminds me. I would like to award the author a hundred points to Griffindor for all the sex positivity in this book. There\\'s nothing explicit or graphic in this book, as befitting as YA novel, but.. oh my god, there\\'s one moment between them, after the bonfire.. it\\'s not kissing, it\\'s not a hug, but considering it\\'s a whole lot of nothing it didn\\'t feel like a whole lot of nothing. Whew. Things were much simpler when we were archenemies.This book isn\\'t all movie quotes, mistaken identities, hidden identities, and churros, though. There\\'s some serious events, some violence, heavy tragic moments, uncertain moments, friendships and relationships that are real and messy and painful and awkward, and yet it all blends so wonderfully. ALEX, APPROXIMATELY might not be blow you out of the water amazing, or maybe it will blow you away, who is to say -- in my case I couldn\\'t pull myself away from this book even for a minute, to the point where I missed dinner and made the executive decision that I can live off words instead of food. But anyway : it\\'s the best kind of feel good, with brilliant and diverse and interesting characters that aren\\'t trying too hard to be those things, and that counts for so much.My only complaint is : what the hell is up with the cover?

Although I can figure out how will the story turns out even before finished reading the summary..but the summary REALLY will spoil you if you have never read this kind of story before. And I regret myself after reading the whole summary of the book. So, I suggest dear people for not reading the summary.Briefly, this story is about Bailey , a film buff who has been messaging with an online friend ( Alex ) in California. Bailey then moves to California without telling Alex and trying to seek him there.But then, she also encounters Roth, who works at the same place as Bailey. Yeah..you can fill in the details.This reminds me a lot like Geekerella. It pretty much has the same plot , the same start of relationship. But, I can say that this book has better and realistic romance development/pace than geekerella. It makes me giggle and punching my pillows like a mad woman. I love both the mcs, and how their smart-ass comments live-up their relationship. I can truly feel and enjoy how both of them start to have feelings and sometimes , I even find myself getting nervous and my heart thumping like crazy. So, just saying that I really feel connected to the characters.Another thing that I like about this book is , there's no complicated confllict that mess up with my mind. I don't have to feel burden or worried about it, which is okay for me because I'm not in the mood for family conflict or anything. Sometimes, I just feel family conflict is annoying ..because members of family should tolerate to each other and dont give your shits to each others, is what I think. My suggestion is, if you are close and might have problems, try to settle down with your family nicely ( idk, never got in this situation ), and if you arent close, probably you are not really open up with them, so, just keep it to yourself and don't mess up with other family members ( this is what I do ). I mean..lol I dont know..this is what I thought, Im not a family therapist or something.And where are we again? oh. you must be wondering as why this is a 3 stars rating. I have a problem towards the ending where I find the hero is being such an ass. I kinda feel like he is being someone else or something. Or am I the only one who think like this?

For a story that deals with such an important build up I would have liked a more satisfying reveal, and less background drama that made it seem like we were losing our / Bailey and Porter\\'s time until the timing was dramatic enough. The setting was really fun, I loved the secondary characters, Grace especially, with whom Bailey shared a very genuine friendship. Bailey herself was quite relatable, at least for me, with her tendency to avoid confrontation and her difficulty to trust. I did enjoy her relationship with Porter by itself, I think the correspondent thing in this case just didn\\'t add anything to the story. We barely saw Alex and Mink interact, and when they did it was nothing of true sustenance / it didn\\'t contribute to their relationship. For a book setting its plot around their online connection, that aspect of the story felt kind of underdeveloped.But hey, it\\'s a ya contemporary, it\\'s fluffy in all the right places, and it holds a+ swoon worthy lines.

       " '\\nActual rating:\\n 2.5/5 stars rounded up to three.I\\'m not a fan of YA Contemporary books (YA Fantasy, on the other hand, is another story) but I didn\\'t think twice about picking up this book because I heard it was inspired by the movies - \"You\\'ve Got Mail\" and \"Shop Around the Corner.\" I\\'ve enjoyed both movies, not just for the unique concept (two people who know each other both online and in real life without realizing it -- however, in one relationship: they are close confidants, and in the other: they are arch-nemesis/rivals of a sort), but I also love the direction the movies took with that idea. I wish I\\'d known that this book is apparently very \"loosely\" inspired by the movies. And that the execution of the premise is a completely different take compared to the movies -- but somewhat standard compared to every other contemporary romance and RomCom. \\nPlot Summary:\\n Our MC, Bailey Rydell, moves to California to live with her father - to avoid the tension of living with her mother and her boyfriend. But moving there also means being in the same place as her online friend, \"Alex\": who knows her as \"Mink\", shares her love for movies but also is someone who is growing to be a close friend - or even more than a friend. But upon arriving, she gets a job at a museum and gets off on the wrong foot with a co-worker, Porter Roth. That relationship between them starts with that heated tension and eventually develops into something deeper as they get to know each other. But the thing is: Alex and Porter are the same guy. And neither Bailey nor Porter know that the other person is the one they\\'ve been talking to online for months. Now, did the book live up to all my expectations of fun and ironic situations that premise can offer?\\nThe Good:\\n Two wonderfully flawed characters, each with their own complexities and past issues, that form a close bond that is very well developed and written. So yes, I liked that Bailey had avoidance issues and had to work on herself to better her friendships/relationships - she\\'s very relatable and mature. And I loved her passion for classic films and movies in general - I was the same when I was a teenager. And Porter, with his ups and downs was also an interesting, fun, and multi-faceted character. \\n\\nMaybe Walt Whitman was right. We all really do contradict ourselves and contain multitudes. How do we even figure out who we really are?\\n\\nThey were both very likable characters with a well written romance. I loved how they could disagree but still get along - there was a lot to appreciate about the characters and their relationship.\\nThe Not-so-good:\\n To be honest, throughout most of the book, I was bored. I spent so long trying to get into it -- two weeks, I think -- but it just wasn\\'t what I was looking for. Here why:* I felt kind of cheated. That\\'s my fault for having expectations and comparing the book to the movies. The whole \"Alex\" issue/mystery quickly fades into the background. Not just that - I mean the online part of their relationship is barely existent, or rather we\\'re shown so very little of it. It doesn\\'t really offset or play into the characters\\' real one - it\\'s more a part of their past than the present. So, really, the whole concept of obliviously knowing one other as two different people - that irony or even the mystery of it - is barely explored. It\\'s not as relevant to the main plot as I thought it would be. * And even putting the Alex/Mink part of the story aside - Porter and Bailey lose that fire and conflict between them too quickly. I expected the tension and heated banter to last a bit longer. They were each other\\'s \"arch-nemesis\" for like 20% of the book and then they were starting to get along and the getting-to-know-you romance started happening. It was... well developed and (there was still strong chemistry and even banter - but the cute type) and all that -- but nothing special to keep me wondering or even caring enough. I wanted more of this:\\n\\nHe holds out the receiver to me. â\\x80\\x9cGo on, say something, superstar.â\\x80\\x9d I shake my head. Not happening. I donâ\\x80\\x99t like the spotlight. Now Iâ\\x80\\x99m regretting that I asked about the yellow button. He tries to coax me into taking it with that laid-back voice of his, but his eyes are 100 percent challenge, like this is some sort of contest, and heâ\\x80\\x99s trying to see whoâ\\x80\\x99ll break first. â\\x80\\x9cCome on. Donâ\\x80\\x99t get shy on me now, glamour girl.â\\x80\\x9d Again with the catty nicknames? What is his problem? Well, he can forget it. Now itâ\\x80\\x99s a matter of principle. I cross my arms over my chest. â\\x80\\x9cNo.â\\x80\\x9d \"Itâ\\x80\\x99s just a little-bitty intercom,â\\x80\\x9d he says, wiggling the receiver in front of me. I shove his hand away. Okay, maybe I kind of slap it away. But Iâ\\x80\\x99ve just about had it with him. Iâ\\x80\\x99m genuinely irritated.\\n\\nPaired up against:\\n@alex: Tell me about your terrible, no-good, really bad day. Does your boss suck? @mink: Eh. Too soon to tell. I got stuck with the crap assignment and one of my coworkers is a colossal dickbag. Heâ\\x80\\x99s going to make my life miserable. I can already tell. @alex: Make him miserable right back. You are Mink! Hear you roar! @mink: *cough* *sputter* *broken meow* @alex: Chin up. Youâ\\x80\\x99ll best this loser. Boys are dumb.\\nThe book was great at the start with moments like that but then the plot shifted mainly to Porter and Bailey\\'s growing relationship (date one, date two, misadventures and life occurences, special moments here and there...)... I started getting restless for something to happen at some point. I kept wondering when the \"Alex\" twist would come back and put a spark back in the book! ((It did but late enough that I stopped caring - and the way it happened made me lose even more interest)).* But wait, let\\'s not forget we have an antagonist in the story for that; Porter\\'s ex-best friend, Davey - who has a bad drug addiction and criminal record, and who once went behind Porter\\'s back with an ex-girlfriend, and now has his mind set on harassing Porter and Bailey... I mean... Was that needed? The original plot/twist would be interesting enough if it was used more prominently - it wouldn\\'t have needed a Davey to shake things up for Porter and Bailey!And I understand that the author meant to show that knowing a person for all they are needs getting to know each other deeply and personally - learning all sides to a person. But if that\\'s the message of the book then it made for a good depiction of a well developed romantic relationship - using the online/offline concept in the background to further its point. But if you\\'re looking for a fun romantic story that takes this concept (of dual identities) and cleverly plays with the possibilities it presents (like I was hoping for) - then watch \"You\\'ve Got Mail\" or \"Shop Around the Corner\" instead. Because this book is not like those movies in that way. It simply turned out to be a regular Contemporary Romance. But if you like Contemporary Romances - or if you like those but avoid the YA genre - then give this a try, because it\\'s a well-written one with a mature romance and complex characters.I just usually prefer when there\\'s a bit of a twist or something beyond the normal to make the story more compelling. That\\'s why I should stick more to Fantasy, Sci-fi, or even Mysteries, and take another break from contemporaries. So maybe my lack of enthusiasm for this book is more of a \"it\\'s me, not you\" situation.',\n",

Bailey moves to a Californian city to live with her dad, which is coincidentally the same city that her online crush 'Alex' lives in. Throw in the classic 'falling for the last person you'd think of' trope and a lot of mature (not NC-17 but real mature adult stuff), you get Alex Approximately.This book is so much more than just the cheesy high-school romance, but more like a story of healing and trust... and boy I felt like this was too mature for a high-school setting. There was a death, hard drugs, physical trauma, a shooting... Real mature stuff for highschoolers... but somehow it all worked, yenno? Alex, Approximately was written fantastically and the plot was just flawlessly executed. We all knew that the ending was, but the journey was the fun part. And boy was it fun!!!Highly recommend for any YA fans. An easy (not necessarily light-hearted) read that'll leave you with a smile. Two thumbs up!!! \",\n",

       " \"New. Favourite. Book. It touched on the usual ya elements like family, friendships, and relationships--but it went so much deeper. It's definitely a more mature ya book though, as it discussed topics such as drugs, crime, and sex.I instantly fell in love with everything this book has to offer. The California setting and beach-y town atmosphere was just so easy to visualize and it felt like you were actually there. I really loved the main character, Bailey, because she's so rational and mature, especially in her relationship with Porter (who is a great love interest by the way). Speaking of relationships, I love the hate-to-love relationship in this one. Their chemistry is through the roof and I also liked that they formed a friendship (unknowingly) through a common interest in old films. Something else I really like was that Grace, Bailey's best friend, and Porter, brought some diversity into this novel, specifically their culture and the food they eat. It added a really nice feel to the book and I'm glad Jenn incorporated it. This book was just so addicting and I couldn't put it down.

The story fits in a lot of themes that are relevant to everyone, not just young adults, and had some very good messages. The setting is also fantastic, just what I needed to get through a cold spring, now I'm ready for summer and wishing the West Coast was closer, I really felt like I was experiencing all those new California things with Bailey as she learned more about her new home. I also loved all the movie references, because my man loves all classic movies, and now I'm motivated to watch some more of them.\",\n",

He is such a babe. â\\x9d¤I like how the book did not solely focused its main themes only on the cheesy romance between two teenagers who are classic movie junkies. There was a happy father & daughter relationship, a female bff friendship, realistic characters, and depths in backstories which is really a plus for me, because that is something some of feel-good type of contemporaries lack most of the time, and a verrrry impressive character growth and development. Also, the sort-of \"mystery\" of Alex made me keep going to read the book. Though it was super obvious from the start who he really was, I still found reading it nice & enjoyable. My only complaint was, there were many unnecessary details in the story which really did not contribute to the progress of it, making some parts way too long and boring. However, that was a tiny stuff that did not massively affected my happy reading.Alex, Approximately is a perfect summer read. It has this sweet, hilarious and realistic romance which I really adore, and the whole thing brought a lot of smiles and laughs to me. Cute, easy-read, and full-on fluff.

       " 'Bailey and her family have been through a lot. Her parents are divorced and her mom has remarried but she and Bailey\\'s stepdad have been fighting a lot so Bailey decides for her own peace of mind to move to California to live with her dad instead. Another bonus is that her dad happens to live in the same town as \"Alex\", a guy she knows through an online group for film fanatics. Bailey is thrilled but also scared to be so near to where Alex is. She decides she will try to find him using clues from his posts. If he seems like a decent guy in real life, then she\\'ll introduce herself. In the meantime, Bailey gets a job at The Cave, a local museum where she makes a new friend, Grace and makes a sort of enemy in Porter. They start off on the wrong foot but Bailey starts to feel differently about Porter as she gets to know him. I love You\\'ve Got Mail so I was immediately intrigued by the premise of this book. I like that Bailey is into classic movies and that she has her own vintage sense of style. Bailey describes herself as an \"Artful Dodger\" and \"evader\". She doesn\\'t like confrontation and she likes relationships to be uncomplicated. Unfortunately for her, life doesn\\'t work that way and she finds herself challenged to grow beyond that. Bailey has something dark in her past that she has to work through as well.At first I didn\\'t think I\\'d like Porter because he comes across as a bit of a jerk but I know that is because of the \"You\\'ve Got Mail retelling\" aspect of the story. Like Bailey, Porter has his own issues to deal with involving a broken friendship and his complicated relationship with surfing. I liked how his relationship with Bailey develops first online and then in person while they don\\'t know about their online connection. I also liked the other relationships in the book, namely the friendship between Bailey and Grace and the positive relationship between Bailey and her dad. They are very close and that is nice to see considering the difficult relationship Bailey has with her mom. Grace is a fun character and she challenges Bailey to come out of her shell. The setting is fun too. I liked learning a little bit about surfing and the beach community. The museum sounds like an interesting place to work though I\\'d hate to work in a hot cramped ticket booth all summer!Overall I thought this was an enjoyable contemporary romance, perfect for summer reading. I\\'d suggest this to fans of You\\'ve Got Mail as well as readers who like Sarah Dessen, Emery Lord and similar authors.',\n",

Bailey, her friend Grace, and Porter had parents who cared & were present when they hung out at each other's houses. You know, like most teens in real life? There was a bit of sneaking around and covering for a friend, but there was also guilt when lies were told to her Dad. Yay for functional yet not perfect families!There was sex, but not detailed and appropriate for a YA novel. I don't usually say that, but these two teens discussed intimacy and limits in a responsible way. I'd be okay with my daughter reading it. Also, it played a small part in the story.

Both Bailey\\'s and Porter\\'s issues with past traumas, and how they deal with life, family, and friends is what added layers to the otherwise pretty predictable plot.As far as protagonist voices go, Bailey\\'s \"Artful Dodger\" evader tendencies and how she grows into facing her issues, is so relatable to anyone who hates dealing with confrontation, negativity, and PTSD.The movie quotes and references for me, as a fellow movie-obsessed person, was what pushed this to a 5-star rating.

It just was not a Surprise And thus the unnecessary angsty tension was not needed\",\n",
       " \"I really enjoyed this book! It was really cute. I enjoyed Bailey's and Porter's chemistry throughout and Mink and Alex's chemistry, in the beginning. I also enjoyed both of their backstories (even though they were super sad, but it made the characters more valuable to me). I loved the character development as well and their relationships with other characters, such as Grace, Porters family, dad and Wanda, sweet Pangborn, and even Davy. I liked how the author added little movie quotes at the top of each chapter and it related to the story somehow. I find Bailey relatable because I find myself to be very awkward, and I tend to avoid confrontations, but I'm trying my best to grow out of it! I also liked how it wasn't cliche, and I couldn't guess what was going to happen next but the one thing I knew (the most important detail) literally through the whole book, that Porter is Alex.The turn offs of this book is that the author spoils who Alex is (Porter) in the description, so I couldn't guess and try to find Alex along with Bailey. But even if she didn't include that detail in the description, it was still really obvious it was Porter... I kind of guessed from the beginning, and there was no other character of who it could have been, other than Patrick, but you know what happens haha. I also didn't like how she didn't figure out it was porter - low key drove me crazy, but I feel like if she knew sooner the rest of the book wouldn't be as exciting.Overall I enjoyed this book so much and I 10/10 recommend. I saw other reviews on this book and people said that this book is like a modern version the movie You've got mail. I haven't watched it but I will. I would love to see this as a movie since it's a unique story and it's something you don't see everyday. But if it does end up being a story, I hope it doesn't ruin it.\",\n",

Sure, this isn't the most unique contemporary book out there as it does play homage to You've Got Mail, but it was definitely heartwarming and such a page-turner. Highly recommend.\",\n",

I loved the characters and their deep storyline and their imperfections which defined them. I loved the fact that Bailey was a museum geek because I am one too. A lot seemed to be going on but everything fit together very well. The only thing that prevents from giving the entire 5 stars is that I felt that the end was slightly rushed, even though I did like how everything turned out but I would have liked there to be maybe a few more chapters.

       " 'To see review with Cary Grant gifs click here.Okay, the blurb completely ruins the book because it pretty much reveals the entire plot of the book.

Iâ\\x80\\x99ll have to say reading this book and all its old film references, was exciting to me. It was like finally meeting with someone who shared your weird old hobby and this book did with its love for old films. And wasnâ\\x80\\x99t even TCM snobby about it which was great.As far as The Shop Around the Corner reduxes go, this one is pretty good. Both characters are surprisingly well fleshed out and have imperfections. I also liked the sleepy beach town setting for the novel. I thought it fit appropriately with the tone of the novel, and the town had enough quirks about it where it was sort of a character of its own.The romance is so of slow burn, and it really worked for me. It takes awhile for Porter and Bailey to tolerate each other, let alone like each other and the growth of the relationship is enjoyable to see with its gradual evolution. On the flip side, we also get to see how their online relationship grows as well. And Iâ\\x80\\x99ll be honest I sort of love the hate to love trope when done right. Especially when they finally admit that they want to be together despite all the obstacles.One thing that did annoy me, was that the dad character wasnâ\\x80\\x99t at least a little freaked out about the fact his daughter had a quasi boyfriend online. Given all the shit that happened to Bailey in the past, you would think heâ\\x80\\x99d be at least skeptical. And for that matter, maybe itâ\\x80\\x99s one too many Lifetime movies (for yours truly) AND being an extremely paranoid person I would really have issues if I had a teenage daughter who randomly met some dude who was trying to get her to fly across the country online.I mean, thatâ\\x80\\x99s reality talking. And normally, I would sort of give it a pass. But given the ultra dramatic back story that this book has, it sort of had me raising a couple of eyebrows.Another problem I had with this book was the random dramatic backstory. It felt a little bit out of place, and in all honesty I felt like it served no purpose other than to describe why the main character was scared of guns.Um, because theyâ\\x80\\x99re guns. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s why.But really, that and a couple of the dramatic side plots couldâ\\x80\\x99ve been cut out and the book may have been better for it. Honestly, I was sort of on the fence about it.

Porter was just really, really generic for me. At first, I thought that maybe he would have a little more depth, but he really ended up being as shallow as a kiddy pool.

       " '*insert a gazillion swoon-y gifs* Alex, Approximately is basically a modern YA retelling of You\\'ve Got Mail/The Shop Around the Corner, so it basically had me sold on this premise alone. (Who doesn\\'t love a good love-hate trope?)However, this is so much more than just a cutesy teen romance. Both Bailey\\'s and Porter\\'s issues with past traumas, and how they deal with life, family, and friends is what added layers to the otherwise pretty predictable plot.As far as protagonist voices go, Bailey\\'s \"Artful Dodger\" evader tendencies and how she grows into facing her issues, is so relatable to anyone who hates dealing with confrontation, negativity, and PTSD.The movie quotes and references for me, as a fellow movie-obsessed person, was what pushed this to a 5-star rating. (Pathetic of me, I know, but I wouldn\\'t have loved it as much if it was a bunch of baseball stats instead, for example.)I really enjoyed reading this, and it\\'s definitely a new contemporary fave.',\n",

       " \"I had some misgivings about this book early on but quickly after it really picked up and it was so freaking CUTE!Also, a YA book that acknowledges girls masturbate and have sexual urges and doesn't shame them for it? \",\n",
       " \"4.5/5Alex approximately is a fun romantic contemporary read that gave me jaw ache (because I just could not stop smiling) yeah towards the last 30 or so pages the story does have an unnecessary angst buildup and I would have felt angsty if I hadn't known Porter was Alex.... but as this book had been marketed as a you have got mail inspired book .... It just was not a Surprise And thus the unnecessary angsty tension was not needed\",\n",
       " \"I really enjoyed this book! It was really cute. I enjoyed Bailey's and Porter's chemistry throughout and Mink and Alex's chemistry, in the beginning. I also enjoyed both of their backstories (even though they were super sad, but it made the characters more valuable to me). I loved the character development as well and their relationships with other characters, such as Grace, Porters family, dad and Wanda, sweet Pangborn, and even Davy. I liked how the author added little movie quotes at the top of each chapter and it related to the story somehow. I find Bailey relatable because I find myself to be very awkward, and I tend to avoid confrontations, but I'm trying my best to grow out of it! I also liked how it wasn't cliche, and I couldn't guess what was going to happen next but the one thing I knew (the most important detail) literally through the whole book, that Porter is Alex.The turn offs of this book is that the author spoils who Alex is (Porter) in the description, so I couldn't guess and try to find Alex along with Bailey. But even if she didn't include that detail in the description, it was still really obvious it was Porter... I kind of guessed from the beginning, and there was no other character of who it could have been, other than Patrick, but you know what happens haha. I also didn't like how she didn't figure out it was porter - low key drove me crazy, but I feel like if she knew sooner the rest of the book wouldn't be as exciting.Overall I enjoyed this book so much and I 10/10 recommend. I saw other reviews on this book and people said that this book is like a modern version the movie You've got mail. I haven't watched it but I will. I would love to see this as a movie since it's a unique story and it's something you don't see everyday. But if it does end up being a story, I hope it doesn't ruin it.\",\n",
       " 'This is precisely the kind of story I needed right now! Definitely 5 stars from me because I genuinely enjoyed every moment of this book! It made me laugh , made me cry , made me want a porter. I just got so frustrated that it took them so long to realise who they were!! Love love love ',\n",
       " \"4.5 stars. This was so close to 5 stars for me and such a step up from her previous contemporary novel (Night Owls). I really connected with Bailey as a character and what she went through resonated with me. I adored all of the characters, the story, the little twists here and there, the romance, the movie references, and especially the movie quotes at the beginning of every chapter. Sure, this isn't the most unique contemporary book out there as it does play homage to You've Got Mail, but it was definitely heartwarming and such a page-turner. Highly recommend.\",\n",
       " 'Can I just say how much I loved Porter purely because he surfed and drove a VW bus? Sigh.',\n",
       " \"4.5 stars is more accurate than just 4 just fyi. I really liked Alex approximately and seeing as I've been waiting for it to come out for some time I'm happy to say that it lived up to my expectations. I loved the characters and their deep storyline and their imperfections which defined them. I loved the fact that Bailey was a museum geek because I am one too. A lot seemed to be going on but everything fit together very well. The only thing that prevents from giving the entire 5 stars is that I felt that the end was slightly rushed, even though I did like how everything turned out but I would have liked there to be maybe a few more chapters. Nonetheless I recommend this to anyone in the mood for a sweet yet intense read and I'm greatly looking forward to more from Jenn Bennett!\",\n",
       " 'To see review with Cary Grant gifs click here.Okay, the blurb completely ruins the book because it pretty much reveals the entire plot of the book. And that is annoying.Sigh.Also, is it just me or was it annoying that this book got all these Youâ\\x80\\x99ve Got Mail comparisons when a good chunk of the book deals with old movies and in turn the comparison shouldâ\\x80\\x99ve been made to The Shop Around the Corner-which for all you non-classic film buffs, is the movie that Youâ\\x80\\x99ve Got Mail based itself on.In fact, itâ\\x80\\x99s sort of referenced in the movie.Okayâ\\x80¦so I probably watched that movie and too many old movies way too much but oh well. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll have to say reading this book and all its old film references, was exciting to me. It was like finally meeting with someone who shared your weird old hobby and this book did with its love for old films. And wasnâ\\x80\\x99t even TCM snobby about it which was great.As far as The Shop Around the Corner reduxes go, this one is pretty good. Both characters are surprisingly well fleshed out and have imperfections. I also liked the sleepy beach town setting for the novel. I thought it fit appropriately with the tone of the novel, and the town had enough quirks about it where it was sort of a character of its own.The romance is so of slow burn, and it really worked for me. It takes awhile for Porter and Bailey to tolerate each other, let alone like each other and the growth of the relationship is enjoyable to see with its gradual evolution. On the flip side, we also get to see how their online relationship grows as well. And Iâ\\x80\\x99ll be honest I sort of love the hate to love trope when done right. Especially when they finally admit that they want to be together despite all the obstacles.One thing that did annoy me, was that the dad character wasnâ\\x80\\x99t at least a little freaked out about the fact his daughter had a quasi boyfriend online. Given all the shit that happened to Bailey in the past, you would think heâ\\x80\\x99d be at least skeptical. And for that matter, maybe itâ\\x80\\x99s one too many Lifetime movies (for yours truly) AND being an extremely paranoid person I would really have issues if I had a teenage daughter who randomly met some dude who was trying to get her to fly across the country online.I mean, thatâ\\x80\\x99s reality talking. And normally, I would sort of give it a pass. But given the ultra dramatic back story that this book has, it sort of had me raising a couple of eyebrows.Another problem I had with this book was the random dramatic backstory. It felt a little bit out of place, and in all honesty I felt like it served no purpose other than to describe why the main character was scared of guns.Um, because theyâ\\x80\\x99re guns. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s why.But really, that and a couple of the dramatic side plots couldâ\\x80\\x99ve been cut out and the book may have been better for it. Honestly, I was sort of on the fence about it. Which is why I rated this book lower than five stars on GoodReads. Still though, it was a very enjoyable read.',\n",

I didn\\'t expect such a seemingly sunny book to \"go there\" with some of the past trauma in the characters\\' lives. But I loved the chemistry between Bailey & Porter, the northern California setting, the kooky museum, the diverse cast of characters, the Vespa, the churros, etc etc.Since I liked this so much I also have nit-picky problems ... like this book would be A++ if only they didn\\'t reveal that Porter was Alex in the blurb, if only the online relationship had a little bit of a bigger role, if only the title was something different (\\'Alex\\' seemed like such a small part of the book to get top billing).',\n",
       " \"This book was a solid 3-star read for me. I did enjoy myself for most of the novel, there were so many cringe-worthy moments that you couldn't help but die of laughter about, and I liked a lot of the dialogue and the witty banter between the two mains. I understood the arc that Bailey was meant to go through, but it felt a bit as though, all of a sudden, she realized the error of her ways and decided to stop evading conflict because the plot told her to. Porter was just really, really generic for me. At first, I thought that maybe he would have a little more depth, but he really ended up being as shallow as a kiddy pool. Not to mention the fact that the pacing of this book was thrown off so much by this need to have these romantic scenes, and so the last chapter ended up being really unsettling for me. If Overall, though, I think this is a good book to get you out of a reading slump.\",\n",
       " 'The book itself was good and the story lines very interesting! I like the pasts of Bailey and Porter, and I loved Bailey\\'s dad!! I ended up deducting two stars and I\\'m not sure if that\\'s me being harsh or me just trying to not be overly generous (I am \"oh, no! I LOVE that ugly green sweater you got me for Christmas Uncle Jimmy!\" kind of nice). I took off one star because I wasn\\'t upset and left wanting more once the book ended. I often get that feeling in really good books, but after this one ended I said, \"okay, next book.\"I deducted the second star because while I enjoyed the pretense of the book and the storyline of the book, I don\\'t feel the description matches up with the story line. The conversations between Mink and Alex are minimal and don\\'t quite feel like a big portion of the story (i.e. Cindy Ella or Cinder & Ella (wow I have a thing for Cinderella stories) or even P.S. I Like You (there, a non Cinderella one!)). I admit I was disappointed because (as you can tell), I do enjoy a good \"I hate you, but I secretly love your messages so now I love you\" book!Other than that I would say the story is good. Character development is strong and I enjoyed the inner dialogue of Bailey. Would recommend for people in high school, early college (if you\\'re into a little more innocent books)!',\n",

Why waste my money on a book I was sure would be added to the dusty pile of DNF books? But there was just something that pulled me back and good God am I glad I went with that feeling.This book is magic. The story is magic. The characters are familiar and relatable. There is drama, there is angst, there is humor, and there is most definitely a hell of a romance. The Romance is the hate to love, slow burn sort. No insta-love bullshit. And they aren't perfect snowflake people either. That's one reason this book works so well. You've got two people that are very clearly flawed and I love that. I could write a lot more about this but it's one of those books that I think you should just dive into blindly. All I can tell you is that this is one of the best contemporary novels I've read in ages and it has earned a spot on my favorite books ever shelf. Read it, love it, devour it.

His head drops to the crook of my neck and rests there. The fingers that were teasing me with their little tap-tap-tapping messages now curl around my fingers, loosely clasping. And the arm pinning me to the mailbox is now lifting away, and I feel his hand smooth down the length of my hair.\\n Porter, Porter, Porter. This boy. I swear. There are so many layers with this boy, but it feels like you\\'ll never get tired in discovering each one. Porter was so easy to love.
