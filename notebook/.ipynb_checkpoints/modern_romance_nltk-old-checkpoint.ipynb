       "  'Overall, I thought Alex, Approximately was a cute and sweet quick read. Perfect for the beach! :)However, there were a few things that bothered me about this novel:- I, unfortunately, can\\'t help but compare this to Things We Know By Heart, which is insanely similar to this novel. I mean, the concept isn\\'t anything new, but the similarities between the novels: wow. Ultimately, I liked both novels about the same, but (view spoiler)[ one thing the Things We Know By Heart gets right is the fact that one of the main characters knows the truth throughout the whole novel. Even in You\\'ve Got Mail, Tom Hanks knows pretty quickly who exactly Meg Ryan is. For some reason, the fact that the characters in Alex, Approximately don\\'t learn the truth until the end of the book makes it weird. I honestly can\\'t put my finger on why exactly it\\'s weird, but for some reason the biggest \"hook\" of the whole novel falls a little flat to me.  (hide spoiler)]- Porter: while I learned to really like the character, first impression: I hate this guy. He doesn\\'t come off very likable in the first couple of chapters and then those actions don\\'t really mesh with the person he turns out to be in the rest of the novel. It\\'s like the author was trying to create this witty banter between them (a sort of love/hate situation) and instead Porter is just flat out MEAN. I really didn\\'t understand that.- Eye-rolling Subplot/Scenes: The whole subplot with Davy made me roll my eyes. It wasn\\'t necessary. at. all. (view spoiler)[ I also found the \"steamy\" scenes to be cringeworthy at various points. There is an art to writing romantic scenes, especially in a YA novel, and some of them in the book were just not good.  (hide spoiler)]- Lastly (and totally minor), the cover! I love the artwork, but in no way doesn\\'t it have anything do with the book other than it looks like they might be watching a movie. Why is there a pool? This book takes place at the beach?!? I just don\\'t get it!Overall, I\\'ll give this novel 3 stars because there were just too many minor things that bothered me about this book. However, I would still recommend this for someone looking for a cute, romantic YA novel. - ',\n",

When I began this book, the premise sounded great and I expected something saturated in cheese and possibly overly sweet...I wasn\\'t quite sure. But it ended up actually having some really heavy elements to it, and the writing was so smart and well done and the romance part is definitely not too sweet- it\\'s a bit more advanced but the characters are older so I thought it was a good fit. The dialogue is great and the characters have great depth. But back to the writing- so good! Her metaphors are unique and not overwrought. I did think that the words \"Artful Dodger\" were used way too much in about the first 30% of the book. That got toned down in the rest though, so it didn\\'t end up being annoying. As I was reading this, I was saying to myself \"I will now read anything Jenn Bennett has ever written,\" stupidly not realizing that she wrote Night Owls which I have on my shelf and will be reading next. So yes. Pick this up. It\\'s wonderful. I love the movie quotes at the beginning of each chapter and how she used old and new movies throughout. '],\n",

I laughed out loud (literally) multiple times, especially \"she has the strength of a tater tot\"-The premise really drew me in, as You\\'ve Got Mail is probably one of my favorite rom-coms ever-Although this is a contemporary novel, the world-building was excellent, something not normally seen in this genre.-Bennett dives further into more graphic and adult topics while still keeping it light-hearted and fun and one does not detract from the other-Bailey wants to be a curator!! Yay job representation!!The Not So Good:-The \\'miscommunication\\'/\\'misunderstanding\\' trope is rife in this novel, which I particularly find immensely frustrating-Bailey and Porter\\'s relationship can be wishy-washy at times, they\\'ll be happy one minute and arguing (not bantering, there\\'s a difference) the next. While I understand Bennett was utilizing the \\'hate to love\\' trope, there\\'s a sharp contrast between playful banter, which they have a lot, to yelling at one another at the drop of a hat.Would I Recommend It?Absolutely! While I did have some problems with the book, it\\'s a great summer read filled with laughter and fun yet still keeping an edge. However, I wish the publishers didn\\'t market it as a \"You\\'ve Got Mail for teens\", because it\\'s really not. I can see how it has elements of the main plot of the film in it, but the online chat forum turns out to be only a minuscule point in Alex, Approximately.

I mean, you can kind of predict how the book will end, but it's a matter of how it gets there that made it worthwhile.The main female character is Bailey Rydell (and every time I read her last name, I though of Rydell High from Grease). She starts her summer by moving across the country to live with her dad. I love how carefree she is and admits that she's a flawed person. She deals with a lot in regards to her family life, but she's trying to make herself better by admitting that she has faults. She's a very likeable person.Her father arranges for her to have a summer job at a nearby museum. She immediately clicks with another teenage girl, and the two become close. Throw in Porter, who is a member of a well-known area family due to his family's success in surfing. He is a completely likeable person from the very beginning, as he's charming and flirty without being overly cocky. I absolutely loved the banter between Baily and Porter.In the mix of all of this is a man named Alex who Bailey has been communicating with via a chat forum. Coincidently, Alex lives in the same town as her father, and Bailey struggles with letting Alex know she's in town vs. slowly developing feelings for Porter.The chemistry between Bailey and Porter was so sweet and swoon-worthy. I couldn't get enough of the two of them and was silently rooting them on. It was a refreshing, fun read and I was sad to finish it so quickly.

Like there was a decent amount of trauma and background for the different characters that felt... really superficial. Also some storylines felt superfluous and unresolved. (view spoiler)[i.e. Davy and the missing mom. I was pretty disturbed by the lack of communication from the mom completely. (hide spoiler)] Learning that Jenn Bennet has a background as a romance writer explains A LOT about how I felt about the plot and background though. I did really like how there was an emphasis on different cultures, such as Porter was Hawaiian and Grace was Nigerian (Grace was also tragically underused and underdeveloped.) The movie obsession was cute, but it also made me laugh because the characters felt so genuinely like teenagers in that moment. Like they talk about a lot of really famous movies, yet Bailey and Porter seemed surprised the other knew the films. I think I was a bit hesitant because You've Got Mail is one of my favorite films and some of the charm of that movie was missing here. About halfway into the book, it really seems like the online flirtation didn't matter anymore, so towards the end when Bailey feels torn didn't quite have the emotional satisfaction I could've hoped for. (The story behind her nickname was very cute). Also by making Bailey's family paranoid of using social media and thus her reason for the ~secrecy~ of talking to a strange online kind of felt like a cop out instead of finding a way to adapt the You've Got Mail storyline into a modern setting.\",\n",

However, that all changed after The Reveal. Then, I thought he was an utter a**hat, a real hypocrite with all his fine talk about truth and honesty, and then essentially treats Bailey like something that needs to be scraped off the bottom of his shoe.When he realizes that Bailey never â\\x80\\x9cplayedâ\\x80\\x9d him or his online persona of Alex, then he relents and magnanimously deigns to talk to her, but even then, he offhandedly portrays blowing her off as some misunderstanding, rather than tell her the truth. To her credit, Bailey doesnâ\\x80\\x99t immediately relent; she is rightfully still hurt and confused and wonâ\\x80\\x99t do the kiss and makeup that Porter wants until she gets some answers. Good on her!But, as to that, Bailey has fairly consistently shown backbone throughout the novel, beginning with tackling the would-be Maltese Falcon thieves, all the way to her epic meltdown in the HotBox. Thus, I felt the author did a disservice to the character by labeling her the Artful Dodger time and again in the book. We readers see very little of that.Frankly, I thought the novel should have dealt a lot more with Baileyâ\\x80\\x99s PTSD concerning the incident with Greg. One gets the sense that even with all the therapy she underwent, there were still unresolved issues and feelings stemming from The Incident. And a major part of the unresolved issue involves Baileyâ\\x80\\x99s mom. Itâ\\x80\\x99s so unreal that her mom basically chose not to contact Bailey all summer! Yes, so they never had an exceptionally close mother-daughter bond in the first place, but the mom character comes across as a narcissistic, unfeeling, person â\\x80\\x93 someone who was the true Artful Dodger of the story.

Because the story was fairly unoriginal (itâ\\x80\\x99s basically â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99ve Got Mailâ\\x80\\x9d but set in the YA milieu), the characters, pacing and narrative needed to elevate the plot, but alas, that was not to be.I thought Grace, Baileyâ\\x80\\x99s BFF was the best character in this book. She was fun, spunky and heck, who doesnâ\\x80\\x99t love a British accent?As for the best part of the book for me? It was the inclusion of a Star Wars quote.

Bailey is a classic movie buff and has made online friends with a fellow movie buff named â\\x80\\x9cAlex,â\\x80\\x9d who also happens to live in this idyllic coastal town.

Iâ\\x80\\x99ll let you fill in the Youâ\\x80\\x99ve Got Mail parallels for yourself.I fully expected the usual romantic comedy plot line of meet cute, misunderstanding/breakup, resolution/reunion. While some of the usual tropes exist in this sweet story, it features an edge and a depth that I didnâ\\x80\\x99t expect. Both Bailey and her love interest have a traumatic experience in their past that keeps them from being completely straight forward with each other and others. And a troubled local teen with a serious drug problem frequently shows up to bring real menace to their otherwise idyllic life.

I also really enjoyed that some serious themes were brought up and handled in a realistic way.But what I loved most was the overall positive writing. Yes, there is some teen drama, and you know what ? The grown-ups figures get involved! Because yes they should. In YA the parents/teachers are too often seen like ennemies, when really, yes, you should ask for their advice. And yes, the characters should call the police when they have to because DUH !And let me tell you about the positive body image! Once again, in YA, sex is often an issue, like it\\'s a forbidden or a dangerous thing, when IRL sex can be such an important part of our lives. So yes, YA authors should talk about positive sex, they should tell teens that sex can be a positive experience, that you don\\'t have to be ashamed of your or your partner\\'s naked body !

As I was reading it I kept debating on stopping, because it's not my normal fare, but something about the way it was written made me keep going. It was an interesting take on You've Got Mail, but I wouldn't call it a retelling, like 90% of the reviews and summaries do. It takes the same concept, but portrays it in a different way, and with teenagers (so no businesses are ever in danger, which takes away a big part of the story), but it's not terrible. I can see teens liking it. \"],\n",
       " ['Alex, Approximately was a sweet, romantic story that you will instantly fall in love with. Bailey moves to the small town of Coronado Cove to live with her father and make a fresh start after a tragic experience. She has been having an â\\x80\\x9conlineâ\\x80\\x9d friendship with Alex, who also lives in Coronado Cove, after bonding due to their love of classic movies. Bailey didnâ\\x80\\x99t tell Alex she was moving near him but hopes that she can find him based on the clues that he gave her during their chats.Baileyâ\\x80\\x99s dad sets her up with a job at a local museum and that is where she meets Porter. Porter is the type of guy that drives us crazy. He is obnoxious, rude and seems to be everywhere that Bailey doesnâ\\x80\\x99t want him to be. The more time that Bailey spends with Porter at work, she realizes that there is more to him then meets the eye and they both bear the scars of a tragic experience. I liked Porter because he was someone who was very protective of the people that he cared about and he was someone who was very special, if people took the time to actually get to know him. I figured out his true identity in the beginning of this story and I was very glad that we got to know Porter just like Bailey did.I also liked Bailey from the very beginning. She was shy but sweet and sassy and she was hoping that moving would help break out of her shell. Over the course of the story she learns that when she takes a chance on life instead of hiding she finds that remarkable things can happen.Ms. Bennett has been one of my favorite writers for a very long time and I loved Alex, Approximately. This beautiful romance is well-written and fun and Iâ\\x80\\x99m looking forward to reading her next book because I know that it will be amazing.'],\n",

It should be noted that the setting is more interesting than the characters and their stories: a lavish mansion turned museum built atop a network of caves wherein a married couple found a cache of hidden treasure (from whence it came is never disclosed), which started years of high life that ultimately lead to their grisly demise in a bitter murder-suicide. Alex, Approximately is amiable enough, but I want to read that book.\"],\n",
       " [\"Don't get me wrong, Alex, Approximately is quite good but the reason for my 3 star rating is more to do with the fact that I expected a bit more. You see, when I read that it's pretty much You've Got Mail with teenagers, I was like, yes, gimmie! But though the plot was very close t one of my favourite 90's rom-coms, the vibe and feel of it didn't come close.Now, the main problem I have with the book is the fact that I didn't find feel the characters and Bailey, our main protagonist, wasn't believable enough. Like, she describes herself as someone who is a master of avoiding conflict, and people in general, but she doesn't feel like someone who is closed up. I would understand if she was closed up to everyone else and our other main character Porter is the only one who brings her out of her shell, but she is open to everyone. And it's a bit contradicting to what she tries to say about herself, which annoyed me.Porter (and don't start with me with the fact that both main characters have drink-related names because both names are pretty rare to begin with and having two of them in the same book.. feels a bit pretentious) is nice though. I liked the sort of bad boy facade which wasn't overly done, but there were moments where I would have liked more explanation and resolve in regards to his certain personality traits. Like, given Bailey's back story, I would have had different reactions to certain aspects of the plot.All in all, it is a very You've Got Mail situation but part of me that liked the movie, felt like the book didn't capture the essence of the movie. And a certain aspect, that I can't reveal because of spoilers, was missing from the book, which is fine, because not every story has to be the same, but I sort of wanted that to happen..

This book was a light read and totally adorable, but I kept thinking, \"Man, I would have LOVED this book in high school!\" I think I might always think this way whenever I read a YA contemporary though...Bailey aka \"Mink\" lives on the East Coast of the U.S. with her mother.

Along the way Bailey gets a summer job at a museum where she meets new friends and her new \"arch nemesis,\" Porter. Little does she know, Porter is actually Alex. I love Bailey. She is a geeky, awkward, and introverted \"evader.\" During the whole story, instead of asking for more personal information from Alex, she evades any sort of confrontation by trying to find out who Alex is in real life on her own. I DID roll my eyes whenever she mentioned this, and I DID get annoyed when obvious clues that pointed to Alex being Porter came up. But I feel like this was part of her character. She also has a back story which may explain why she likes to avoid things. I also adored Porter. He\\'s a witty security guard and surfer who gets along with his family yet seems to have a bit of a temper when he is not happy with someone. I also liked that this book was set mostly near a boardwalk and a museum in California. I kind of pictured this being at the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk because of the mention of the redwood trees. California churros definitely taste as good as Bailey makes them out to be!I guess because this book is a romance, Bailey and Alex were the only characters who were fully developed. I would have liked to know more about Bailey\\'s mother, Porter\\'s father, Grace, and Davy. Especially Davy. He is Porter\\'s former/friend who is all kinds of messed up with parents who don\\'t seem to care. I\\'m being picky but because I\\'m from California, the geography confused me! Sometimes I would think they lived in Northern California, but Coronado is in Southern California. The redwoods are also near the Santa Cruz Boardwalk (which is why I kept picturing this happening at the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk) while the Sequoias are more in the SoCal area. Big Sur is also way up in NorCal. I also don\\'t think it\\'s possible to just spend a day in San Francisco when you live in Coronado, but they could have left in the morning I suppose. California is a huge state!I recommend this book to anyone who wants a cute light read and loves a great classic film!'],\n",

I definitely wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t look to it as a paragon of well-written literature, but it was much better quality than a lot of YA contemporary fluff.

She meets a boy nicknamed 'Alex' online on a movie forum and they share a lot of things in common. Alex wants her to travel to California because they are going to have this big movie festival during summer and there is a movie he wants her to see, plus because they click so much, he wants to meet her. When her mother's relationship ends up on the rocks with her current husband, Bailey feels like she has had enough drama and moves to California to live with her dad.It just happens that Alex, also lives in the same city as her dad.Bailey get's cold feet and never tells 'Alex' that she is in town in hopes of scoping out the boy first, in case he is a creepy old man, and with her past she has every right to be careful.Unfortunately the search for Alex hits home a lot closer than she thinks.Can I just say I absolutely loved and adored this book. As far as romances go, this is like one of my top five favorites of this year so far. I had so much fun with this, with Bailey and Porter. I adored them.When the two first meet at work, it's a bit rocky. Porter comes off like an ass and Bailey does not want to cower in front of him.In fact, right from the start he really pisses her off. The two end up arguing a lot, but when they don't fight, sparks fly and magic happens. It turns out, Porter actually really likes her.I just loved this I really did. I needed something light after reading a dark book and this helped a lot. Lately I've also been enjoying Young Adult Contemporary because I haven't read a lot of them. Plus, it helps with the Adult Romance rot I am currently feeling.Bailey and Porter were great together. Not only did I love their relationship. I enjoyed the positive family relationships as well as friendships that developed in this book.I absolutely adored how everything unfolded and that Porter is actually Alex and how the two clicked offline, without actually knowing who the two really are. (This is not a spoiler, it's in the blurb y'all)There wasn't much that I disliked about this book except for the part where Bailey felt a bit thick when it came to the big reveal. Porter kind of put the two and two together first and his reaction made me a bit grumpy, but I just couldn't understand how Bailey did not see the missing puzzle piece when everything was sitting in front of her. Honestly, she should have put the two together a lot more quickly.Also, the Davy storyline in this was a little rough and a bit weirdly unnecessary.Overall, this was a great read - currently top 5 romance favorites this year. It was well written, with a wonderful storyline, great characters, positive relationships with friends, family and between Bailey and Porter.I loved Porter, I really did.

He\\'s an electrical outlet, and I\\'m the stupid toddler, always trying to poke around and stick my finger inside.There are so many movie references in ALEX, APPROXIMATELY that I don\\'t know where to start. But the easiest way to describe this book is basically the bare bones concept of You\\'ve Got Mail but for teens. Except it goes a little something like this : boy meets girl on film festival forum. Boy and girl talk online for months. Boy wants girl to come out to California and see a movie with him -- and, I mean, also visit her father who happens to live in the same town. Girl has avoidance issues and refuses to commit, also because of reasons. Girl decides to make an educated decision about boy without telling him and flies to California for the summer and try and track him down without him knowing. The hunt doesn\\'t go well. And then there\\'s also Porter.Being with Porter is crazy and exciting. And much like a great thriller film, I\\'m not sure who\\'s going to end up dead by the closing credits.Bailey, as stated in her own words, likes to avoid messy and awkward and potentially damaging and/or hurtful situations. She\\'s shy on the onset and generally prefers to avoid confrontations in any way possible. And can I just say how much I loved this girl. I loved her baggage, even though it broke my heart and was so real and man Bennett did a great job making this a thing without making it a thing, but I loved her growth more. I loved how she evolves, not only because of a boy, but because of a wonderful female-friendship (no catty ladies here!) and also for herself. Maybe Walt Whitman was right. We all really do contradict ourselves and contain multitudes.And then there\\'s Porter. I don\\'t think I have words for what this boy is. Other than brilliant and hilarious and snarky and hardcore and sweet and brilliant and wonderful and arg. \"You might want to look away if you\\'re sensitive to dynamite male bodies. I don\\'t want you swooning at the sight of raw surfer.\"Oh, and cocky. He\\'s that, too.\"You always go around sticking your hands down boys\\' clothes?\"\"When they\\'re full of baked goods.\"\"Tomorrow I\\'m coming to work with ten pounds of pastries in my pants.\"The hate-to-love trope isn\\'t getting old anytime soon but the bonus to this relationship is it actually seemed a little more enemies-to-friends-who-want-to-bang. Which reminds me. I would like to award the author a hundred points to Griffindor for all the sex positivity in this book. There\\'s nothing explicit or graphic in this book, as befitting as YA novel, but.. oh my god, there\\'s one moment between them, after the bonfire.. it\\'s not kissing, it\\'s not a hug, but considering it\\'s a whole lot of nothing it didn\\'t feel like a whole lot of nothing. Whew. Things were much simpler when we were archenemies.This book isn\\'t all movie quotes, mistaken identities, hidden identities, and churros, though. There\\'s some serious events, some violence, heavy tragic moments, uncertain moments, friendships and relationships that are real and messy and painful and awkward, and yet it all blends so wonderfully. ALEX, APPROXIMATELY might not be blow you out of the water amazing, or maybe it will blow you away, who is to say -- in my case I couldn\\'t pull myself away from this book even for a minute, to the point where I missed dinner and made the executive decision that I can live off words instead of food.

       " [\"This is a very good light reading for summer!!Full reviewI dont know if the summary is suppose to spoil you or not. Although I can figure out how will the story turns out even before finished reading the summary..but the summary REALLY will spoil you if you have never read this kind of story before. And I regret myself after reading the whole summary of the book. So, I suggest dear people for not reading the summary.Briefly, this story is about Bailey , a film buff who has been messaging with an online friend ( Alex ) in California. Bailey then moves to California without telling Alex and trying to seek him there.But then, she also encounters Roth, who works at the same place as Bailey. Yeah..you can fill in the details.This reminds me a lot like Geekerella. It pretty much has the same plot , the same start of relationship. But, I can say that this book has better and realistic romance development/pace than geekerella. It makes me giggle and punching my pillows like a mad woman. I love both the mcs, and how their smart-ass comments live-up their relationship. I can truly feel and enjoy how both of them start to have feelings and sometimes , I even find myself getting nervous and my heart thumping like crazy. So, just saying that I really feel connected to the characters.Another thing that I like about this book is , there's no complicated confllict that mess up with my mind. I don't have to feel burden or worried about it, which is okay for me because I'm not in the mood for family conflict or anything. Sometimes, I just feel family conflict is annoying ..because members of family should tolerate to each other and dont give your shits to each others, is what I think. My suggestion is, if you are close and might have problems, try to settle down with your family nicely ( idk, never got in this situation ), and if you arent close, probably you are not really open up with them, so, just keep it to yourself and don't mess up with other family members ( this is what I do ). I mean..lol I dont know..this is what I thought, Im not a family therapist or something.And where are we again? oh. you must be wondering as why this is a 3 stars rating. I have a problem towards the ending where I find the hero is being such an ass. I kinda feel like he is being someone else or something. Or am I the only one who think like this? So, yeah..Alex, approximately is a cool story. I really like it. I recommend it to those who would like to read something light for summer reading. \"],\n",

For a story that deals with such an important build up I would have liked a more satisfying reveal, and less background drama that made it seem like we were losing our / Bailey and Porter\\'s time until the timing was dramatic enough. The setting was really fun, I loved the secondary characters, Grace especially, with whom Bailey shared a very genuine friendship. Bailey herself was quite relatable, at least for me, with her tendency to avoid confrontation and her difficulty to trust. I did enjoy her relationship with Porter by itself, I think the correspondent thing in this case just didn\\'t add anything to the story. We barely saw Alex and Mink interact, and when they did it was nothing of true sustenance / it didn\\'t contribute to their relationship. For a book setting its plot around their online connection, that aspect of the story felt kind of underdeveloped.But hey, it\\'s a ya contemporary, it\\'s fluffy in all the right places, and it holds a+ swoon worthy lines.

       " ['\\nActual rating:\\n 2.5/5 stars rounded up to three.I\\'m not a fan of YA Contemporary books (YA Fantasy, on the other hand, is another story) but I didn\\'t think twice about picking up this book because I heard it was inspired by the movies - \"You\\'ve Got Mail\" and \"Shop Around the Corner.\" I\\'ve enjoyed both movies, not just for the unique concept (two people who know each other both online and in real life without realizing it -- however, in one relationship: they are close confidants, and in the other: they are arch-nemesis/rivals of a sort), but I also love the direction the movies took with that idea. I wish I\\'d known that this book is apparently very \"loosely\" inspired by the movies. And that the execution of the premise is a completely different take compared to the movies -- but somewhat standard compared to every other contemporary romance and RomCom. \\nPlot Summary:\\n Our MC, Bailey Rydell, moves to California to live with her father - to avoid the tension of living with her mother and her boyfriend. But moving there also means being in the same place as her online friend, \"Alex\": who knows her as \"Mink\", shares her love for movies but also is someone who is growing to be a close friend - or even more than a friend. But upon arriving, she gets a job at a museum and gets off on the wrong foot with a co-worker, Porter Roth. That relationship between them starts with that heated tension and eventually develops into something deeper as they get to know each other. But the thing is: Alex and Porter are the same guy. And neither Bailey nor Porter know that the other person is the one they\\'ve been talking to online for months. Now, did the book live up to all my expectations of fun and ironic situations that premise can offer?\\nThe Good:\\n Two wonderfully flawed characters, each with their own complexities and past issues, that form a close bond that is very well developed and written. So yes, I liked that Bailey had avoidance issues and had to work on herself to better her friendships/relationships - she\\'s very relatable and mature. And I loved her passion for classic films and movies in general - I was the same when I was a teenager. And Porter, with his ups and downs was also an interesting, fun, and multi-faceted character. \\n\\nMaybe Walt Whitman was right. We all really do contradict ourselves and contain multitudes. How do we even figure out who we really are?\\n\\nThey were both very likable characters with a well written romance. I loved how they could disagree but still get along - there was a lot to appreciate about the characters and their relationship.\\nThe Not-so-good:\\n To be honest, throughout most of the book, I was bored. I spent so long trying to get into it -- two weeks, I think -- but it just wasn\\'t what I was looking for. Here why:* I felt kind of cheated. That\\'s my fault for having expectations and comparing the book to the movies. The whole \"Alex\" issue/mystery quickly fades into the background. Not just that - I mean the online part of their relationship is barely existent, or rather we\\'re shown so very little of it. It doesn\\'t really offset or play into the characters\\' real one - it\\'s more a part of their past than the present. So, really, the whole concept of obliviously knowing one other as two different people - that irony or even the mystery of it - is barely explored. It\\'s not as relevant to the main plot as I thought it would be. * And even putting the Alex/Mink part of the story aside - Porter and Bailey lose that fire and conflict between them too quickly. I expected the tension and heated banter to last a bit longer. They were each other\\'s \"arch-nemesis\" for like 20% of the book and then they were starting to get along and the getting-to-know-you romance started happening. It was... well developed and (there was still strong chemistry and even banter - but the cute type) and all that -- but nothing special to keep me wondering or even caring enough. I wanted more of this:\\n\\nHe holds out the receiver to me. â\\x80\\x9cGo on, say something, superstar.â\\x80\\x9d I shake my head. Not happening. I donâ\\x80\\x99t like the spotlight. Now Iâ\\x80\\x99m regretting that I asked about the yellow button. He tries to coax me into taking it with that laid-back voice of his, but his eyes are 100 percent challenge, like this is some sort of contest, and heâ\\x80\\x99s trying to see whoâ\\x80\\x99ll break first. â\\x80\\x9cCome on. Donâ\\x80\\x99t get shy on me now, glamour girl.â\\x80\\x9d Again with the catty nicknames? What is his problem? Well, he can forget it. Now itâ\\x80\\x99s a matter of principle. I cross my arms over my chest. â\\x80\\x9cNo.â\\x80\\x9d \"Itâ\\x80\\x99s just a little-bitty intercom,â\\x80\\x9d he says, wiggling the receiver in front of me. I shove his hand away. Okay, maybe I kind of slap it away. But Iâ\\x80\\x99ve just about had it with him. Iâ\\x80\\x99m genuinely irritated.\\n\\nPaired up against:\\n@alex: Tell me about your terrible, no-good, really bad day. Does your boss suck? @mink: Eh. Too soon to tell. I got stuck with the crap assignment and one of my coworkers is a colossal dickbag. Heâ\\x80\\x99s going to make my life miserable. I can already tell. @alex: Make him miserable right back. You are Mink! Hear you roar! @mink: *cough* *sputter* *broken meow* @alex: Chin up. Youâ\\x80\\x99ll best this loser. Boys are dumb.\\nThe book was great at the start with moments like that but then the plot shifted mainly to Porter and Bailey\\'s growing relationship (date one, date two, misadventures and life occurences, special moments here and there...)... I started getting restless for something to happen at some point. I kept wondering when the \"Alex\" twist would come back and put a spark back in the book! ((It did but late enough that I stopped caring - and the way it happened made me lose even more interest)).* But wait, let\\'s not forget we have an antagonist in the story for that; Porter\\'s ex-best friend, Davey - who has a bad drug addiction and criminal record, and who once went behind Porter\\'s back with an ex-girlfriend, and now has his mind set on harassing Porter and Bailey... I mean... Was that needed? The original plot/twist would be interesting enough if it was used more prominently - it wouldn\\'t have needed a Davey to shake things up for Porter and Bailey!And I understand that the author meant to show that knowing a person for all they are needs getting to know each other deeply and personally - learning all sides to a person. But if that\\'s the message of the book then it made for a good depiction of a well developed romantic relationship - using the online/offline concept in the background to further its point. But if you\\'re looking for a fun romantic story that takes this concept (of dual identities) and cleverly plays with the possibilities it presents (like I was hoping for) - then watch \"You\\'ve Got Mail\" or \"Shop Around the Corner\" instead. Because this book is not like those movies in that way. It simply turned out to be a regular Contemporary Romance. But if you like Contemporary Romances - or if you like those but avoid the YA genre - then give this a try, because it\\'s a well-written one with a mature romance and complex characters.I just usually prefer when there\\'s a bit of a twist or something beyond the normal to make the story more compelling. That\\'s why I should stick more to Fantasy, Sci-fi, or even Mysteries, and take another break from contemporaries. So maybe my lack of enthusiasm for this book is more of a \"it\\'s me, not you\" situation.'],\n",

Throw in the classic 'falling for the last person you'd think of' trope and a lot of mature (not NC-17 but real mature adult stuff), you get Alex Approximately.This book is so much more than just the cheesy high-school romance, but more like a story of healing and trust... and boy I felt like this was too mature for a high-school setting. There was a death, hard drugs, physical trauma, a shooting... Real mature stuff for highschoolers... but somehow it all worked, yenno?

The California setting and beach-y town atmosphere was just so easy to visualize and it felt like you were actually there.

Speaking of relationships, I love the hate-to-love relationship in this one. Their chemistry is through the roof and I also liked that they formed a friendship (unknowingly) through a common interest in old films. Something else I really like was that Grace, Bailey's best friend, and Porter, brought some diversity into this novel, specifically their culture and the food they eat.

This book follows Bailey who recently moved to California to live with her dad, where incidentally her online boyfriend lives. Bailey is still recovering from a rather dark incident in her past that has given her PTSD. She spends time online with Alex watching classic movies. She begins working at a museum and finds herself dealing with the rather annoying Porter. Then she finds herself falling for him. But he couldn't possibly be Alex, could he? This book is full of romance and mystery. For the parents, if you have a younger teen I would recommend reading first. There is sex, drug use (by a minor character), violence, and the main character is definitely suffering from PTSD. \"],\n",

Another bonus is that her dad happens to live in the same town as \"Alex\", a guy she knows through an online group for film fanatics. Bailey is thrilled but also scared to be so near to where Alex is. She decides she will try to find him using clues from his posts. If he seems like a decent guy in real life, then she\\'ll introduce herself. In the meantime, Bailey gets a job at The Cave, a local museum where she makes a new friend, Grace and makes a sort of enemy in Porter. They start off on the wrong foot but Bailey starts to feel differently about Porter as she gets to know him. I love You\\'ve Got Mail so I was immediately intrigued by the premise of this book. I like that Bailey is into classic movies and that she has her own vintage sense of style. Bailey describes herself as an \"Artful Dodger\" and \"evader\". She doesn\\'t like confrontation and she likes relationships to be uncomplicated. Unfortunately for her, life doesn\\'t work that way and she finds herself challenged to grow beyond that. Bailey has something dark in her past that she has to work through as well.At first I didn\\'t think I\\'d like Porter because he comes across as a bit of a jerk but I know that is because of the \"You\\'ve Got Mail retelling\" aspect of the story. Like Bailey, Porter has his own issues to deal with involving a broken friendship and his complicated relationship with surfing. I liked how his relationship with Bailey develops first online and then in person while they don\\'t know about their online connection. I also liked the other relationships in the book, namely the friendship between Bailey and Grace and the positive relationship between Bailey and her dad. They are very close and that is nice to see considering the difficult relationship Bailey has with her mom. Grace is a fun character and she challenges Bailey to come out of her shell. The setting is fun too. I liked learning a little bit about surfing and the beach community.

I find Bailey relatable because I find myself to be very awkward, and I tend to avoid confrontations, but I'm trying my best to grow out of it! I also liked how it wasn't cliche, and I couldn't guess what was going to happen next but the one thing I knew (the most important detail) literally through the whole book, that Porter is Alex.The turn offs of this book is that the author spoils who Alex is (Porter) in the description, so I couldn't guess and try to find Alex along with Bailey. But even if she didn't include that detail in the description, it was still really obvious it was Porter... I kind of guessed from the beginning, and there was no other character of who it could have been, other than Patrick, but you know what happens haha.

Both characters are surprisingly well fleshed out and have imperfections. I also liked the sleepy beach town setting for the novel. I thought it fit appropriately with the tone of the novel, and the town had enough quirks about it where it was sort of a character of its own.The romance is so of slow burn, and it really worked for me. It takes awhile for Porter and Bailey to tolerate each other, let alone like each other and the growth of the relationship is enjoyable to see with its gradual evolution. On the flip side, we also get to see how their online relationship grows as well. And Iâ\\x80\\x99ll be honest I sort of love the hate to love trope when done right. Especially when they finally admit that they want to be together despite all the obstacles.One thing that did annoy me, was that the dad character wasnâ\\x80\\x99t at least a little freaked out about the fact his daughter had a quasi boyfriend online. Given all the shit that happened to Bailey in the past, you would think heâ\\x80\\x99d be at least skeptical.

And normally, I would sort of give it a pass. But given the ultra dramatic back story that this book has, it sort of had me raising a couple of eyebrows.Another problem I had with this book was the random dramatic backstory. It felt a little bit out of place, and in all honesty I felt like it served no purpose other than to describe why the main character was scared of guns.Um, because theyâ\\x80\\x99re guns. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s why.But really, that and a couple of the dramatic side plots couldâ\\x80\\x99ve been cut out and the book may have been better for it. Honestly, I was sort of on the fence about it.

       " ['*insert a gazillion swoon-y gifs* Alex, Approximately is basically a modern YA retelling of You\\'ve Got Mail/The Shop Around the Corner, so it basically had me sold on this premise alone. (Who doesn\\'t love a good love-hate trope?)However, this is so much more than just a cutesy teen romance. Both Bailey\\'s and Porter\\'s issues with past traumas, and how they deal with life, family, and friends is what added layers to the otherwise pretty predictable plot.As far as protagonist voices go, Bailey\\'s \"Artful Dodger\" evader tendencies and how she grows into facing her issues, is so relatable to anyone who hates dealing with confrontation, negativity, and PTSD.The movie quotes and references for me, as a fellow movie-obsessed person, was what pushed this to a 5-star rating.

       " [\"I really enjoyed this book! It was really cute. I enjoyed Bailey's and Porter's chemistry throughout and Mink and Alex's chemistry, in the beginning. I also enjoyed both of their backstories (even though they were super sad, but it made the characters more valuable to me). I loved the character development as well and their relationships with other characters, such as Grace, Porters family, dad and Wanda, sweet Pangborn, and even Davy. I liked how the author added little movie quotes at the top of each chapter and it related to the story somehow. I find Bailey relatable because I find myself to be very awkward, and I tend to avoid confrontations, but I'm trying my best to grow out of it! I also liked how it wasn't cliche, and I couldn't guess what was going to happen next but the one thing I knew (the most important detail) literally through the whole book, that Porter is Alex.The turn offs of this book is that the author spoils who Alex is (Porter) in the description, so I couldn't guess and try to find Alex along with Bailey. But even if she didn't include that detail in the description, it was still really obvious it was Porter... I kind of guessed from the beginning, and there was no other character of who it could have been, other than Patrick, but you know what happens haha. I also didn't like how she didn't figure out it was porter - low key drove me crazy, but I feel like if she knew sooner the rest of the book wouldn't be as exciting.Overall I enjoyed this book so much and I 10/10 recommend. I saw other reviews on this book and people said that this book is like a modern version the movie You've got mail. I haven't watched it but I will. I would love to see this as a movie since it's a unique story and it's something you don't see everyday. But if it does end up being a story, I hope it doesn't ruin it.\"],\n",

I really connected with Bailey as a character and what she went through resonated with me. I adored all of the characters, the story, the little twists here and there, the romance, the movie references, and especially the movie quotes at the beginning of every chapter. Sure, this isn't the most unique contemporary book out there as it does play homage to You've Got Mail, but it was definitely heartwarming and such a page-turner. Highly recommend.\"],\n",

I really liked Alex approximately and seeing as I've been waiting for it to come out for some time I'm happy to say that it lived up to my expectations. I loved the characters and their deep storyline and their imperfections which defined them. I loved the fact that Bailey was a museum geek because I am one too. A lot seemed to be going on but everything fit together very well. The only thing that prevents from giving the entire 5 stars is that I felt that the end was slightly rushed, even though I did like how everything turned out but I would have liked there to be maybe a few more chapters. Nonetheless I recommend this to anyone in the mood for a sweet yet intense read and I'm greatly looking forward to more from Jenn Bennett!\"],\n",
       " ['To see review with Cary Grant gifs click here.Okay, the blurb completely ruins the book because it pretty much reveals the entire plot of the book. And that is annoying.Sigh.Also, is it just me or was it annoying that this book got all these Youâ\\x80\\x99ve Got Mail comparisons when a good chunk of the book deals with old movies and in turn the comparison shouldâ\\x80\\x99ve been made to The Shop Around the Corner-which for all you non-classic film buffs, is the movie that Youâ\\x80\\x99ve Got Mail based itself on.In fact, itâ\\x80\\x99s sort of referenced in the movie.Okayâ\\x80¦so I probably watched that movie and too many old movies way too much but oh well. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll have to say reading this book and all its old film references, was exciting to me. It was like finally meeting with someone who shared your weird old hobby and this book did with its love for old films. And wasnâ\\x80\\x99t even TCM snobby about it which was great.As far as The Shop Around the Corner reduxes go, this one is pretty good. Both characters are surprisingly well fleshed out and have imperfections. I also liked the sleepy beach town setting for the novel. I thought it fit appropriately with the tone of the novel, and the town had enough quirks about it where it was sort of a character of its own.The romance is so of slow burn, and it really worked for me. It takes awhile for Porter and Bailey to tolerate each other, let alone like each other and the growth of the relationship is enjoyable to see with its gradual evolution. On the flip side, we also get to see how their online relationship grows as well. And Iâ\\x80\\x99ll be honest I sort of love the hate to love trope when done right. Especially when they finally admit that they want to be together despite all the obstacles.One thing that did annoy me, was that the dad character wasnâ\\x80\\x99t at least a little freaked out about the fact his daughter had a quasi boyfriend online. Given all the shit that happened to Bailey in the past, you would think heâ\\x80\\x99d be at least skeptical. And for that matter, maybe itâ\\x80\\x99s one too many Lifetime movies (for yours truly) AND being an extremely paranoid person I would really have issues if I had a teenage daughter who randomly met some dude who was trying to get her to fly across the country online.I mean, thatâ\\x80\\x99s reality talking. And normally, I would sort of give it a pass. But given the ultra dramatic back story that this book has, it sort of had me raising a couple of eyebrows.Another problem I had with this book was the random dramatic backstory. It felt a little bit out of place, and in all honesty I felt like it served no purpose other than to describe why the main character was scared of guns.Um, because theyâ\\x80\\x99re guns. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s why.But really, that and a couple of the dramatic side plots couldâ\\x80\\x99ve been cut out and the book may have been better for it. Honestly, I was sort of on the fence about it. Which is why I rated this book lower than five stars on GoodReads. Still though, it was a very enjoyable read.'],\n",

I understood the arc that Bailey was meant to go through, but it felt a bit as though, all of a sudden, she realized the error of her ways and decided to stop evading conflict because the plot told her to. Porter was just really, really generic for me. At first, I thought that maybe he would have a little more depth, but he really ended up being as shallow as a kiddy pool.

The conversations between Mink and Alex are minimal and don\\'t quite feel like a big portion of the story (i.e. Cindy Ella or Cinder & Ella (wow I have a thing for Cinderella stories) or even P.S.

Bailey\\'s having to work in the \"hot box\" and sweat all day, the incredibly old-school security system, the silly-named rooms... Jenn Bennett knows how to make you feel connected to every single person, place and thing in her stories.Welp, Jenn Bennett did it again!!! She completely blew me away with \\nThe Anatomical Shape of a Heart\\n last year, and Jack has been my book boyfriend since I first met him. And guys, here comes Porter, now sitting at the very tippity top of my BBF list right along side him!! â\\x99¥ Relatable characters that are so real they are impossible not to connect with, a romance that\\'s so fun, silly and swoony you\\'ll fall hard, and a storyline that is unputdownable from beginning to end, this is a real gem. If you love adorableness, topped with all the swooning, and a side of emotions, this is a must-read for you!\\n(Thanks to Simon Pulse for the review copy!)Find this review and others like it at Lost in Literature!\\n\\n\\n']]"

       " 'Overall, I thought Alex, Approximately was a cute and sweet quick read. Perfect for the beach! :)However, there were a few things that bothered me about this novel:- I, unfortunately, can\\'t help but compare this to Things We Know By Heart, which is insanely similar to this novel. I mean, the concept isn\\'t anything new, but the similarities between the novels: wow. Ultimately, I liked both novels about the same, but (view spoiler)[ one thing the Things We Know By Heart gets right is the fact that one of the main characters knows the truth throughout the whole novel. Even in You\\'ve Got Mail, Tom Hanks knows pretty quickly who exactly Meg Ryan is. For some reason, the fact that the characters in Alex, Approximately don\\'t learn the truth until the end of the book makes it weird. I honestly can\\'t put my finger on why exactly it\\'s weird, but for some reason the biggest \"hook\" of the whole novel falls a little flat to me.  (hide spoiler)]- Porter: while I learned to really like the character, first impression: I hate this guy. He doesn\\'t come off very likable in the first couple of chapters and then those actions don\\'t really mesh with the person he turns out to be in the rest of the novel. It\\'s like the author was trying to create this witty banter between them (a sort of love/hate situation) and instead Porter is just flat out MEAN. I really didn\\'t understand that.- Eye-rolling Subplot/Scenes: The whole subplot with Davy made me roll my eyes. It wasn\\'t necessary. at. all. (view spoiler)[ I also found the \"steamy\" scenes to be cringeworthy at various points. There is an art to writing romantic scenes, especially in a YA novel, and some of them in the book were just not good.  (hide spoiler)]- Lastly (and totally minor), the cover! I love the artwork, but in no way doesn\\'t it have anything do with the book other than it looks like they might be watching a movie. Why is there a pool? This book takes place at the beach?!? I just don\\'t get it!Overall, I\\'ll give this novel 3 stars because there were just too many minor things that bothered me about this book.

When I began this book, the premise sounded great and I expected something saturated in cheese and possibly overly sweet...I wasn\\'t quite sure. But it ended up actually having some really heavy elements to it, and the writing was so smart and well done and the romance part is definitely not too sweet- it\\'s a bit more advanced but the characters are older so I thought it was a good fit. The dialogue is great and the characters have great depth. But back to the writing- so good! Her metaphors are unique and not overwrought. I did think that the words \"Artful Dodger\" were used way too much in about the first 30% of the book. That got toned down in the rest though, so it didn\\'t end up being annoying. As I was reading this, I was saying to myself \"I will now read anything Jenn Bennett has ever written,\" stupidly not realizing that she wrote Night Owls which I have on my shelf and will be reading next.

It was fun to see the online interactions between Mika and Alex as well. Porter was so flirty and sarcastic and Bailey was outspoken but also had her reservations she had a hard time letting people in. I really enjoyed all the classic movie references as well as all the movie quotes at the beginning of every chapter.

       " 'The Good:-This book was hilarious. I laughed out loud (literally) multiple times, especially \"she has the strength of a tater tot\"-The premise really drew me in, as You\\'ve Got Mail is probably one of my favorite rom-coms ever-Although this is a contemporary novel, the world-building was excellent, something not normally seen in this genre.-Bennett dives further into more graphic and adult topics while still keeping it light-hearted and fun and one does not detract from the other-Bailey wants to be a curator!! Yay job representation!!The Not So Good:-The \\'miscommunication\\'/\\'misunderstanding\\' trope is rife in this novel, which I particularly find immensely frustrating-Bailey and Porter\\'s relationship can be wishy-washy at times, they\\'ll be happy one minute and arguing (not bantering, there\\'s a difference) the next. While I understand Bennett was utilizing the \\'hate to love\\' trope, there\\'s a sharp contrast between playful banter, which they have a lot, to yelling at one another at the drop of a hat.Would I Recommend It?Absolutely! While I did have some problems with the book, it\\'s a great summer read filled with laughter and fun yet still keeping an edge. However, I wish the publishers didn\\'t market it as a \"You\\'ve Got Mail for teens\", because it\\'s really not. I can see how it has elements of the main plot of the film in it, but the online chat forum turns out to be only a minuscule point in Alex, Approximately. I could have been overly disappointed in the plot because I know the source material like the back of my hand, but don\\'t market your book to be something it isn\\'t. (Also watch the film it\\'s 11/10)Rating:4/5; B-Favorite Quote:Truthfully, the tater tot one is, but here\\'s my second favorite:\"But just when you think you understand someone, it turns out that you didn\\'t know them at all. Or maybe the real problem was that you didn\\'t understand something about yourself.\"',\n",
       " \"I had a hard time putting this one down--I absolutely loved it!Apparently the premise of the book is similar to You've Got Mail, but seeing as I never saw the movie, I felt my feelings weren't skewed. I mean, you can kind of predict how the book will end, but it's a matter of how it gets there that made it worthwhile.The main female character is Bailey Rydell (and every time I read her last name, I though of Rydell High from Grease). She starts her summer by moving across the country to live with her dad. I love how carefree she is and admits that she's a flawed person. She deals with a lot in regards to her family life, but she's trying to make herself better by admitting that she has faults. She's a very likeable person.Her father arranges for her to have a summer job at a nearby museum. She immediately clicks with another teenage girl, and the two become close. Throw in Porter, who is a member of a well-known area family due to his family's success in surfing. He is a completely likeable person from the very beginning, as he's charming and flirty without being overly cocky. I absolutely loved the banter between Baily and Porter.In the mix of all of this is a man named Alex who Bailey has been communicating with via a chat forum. Coincidently, Alex lives in the same town as her father, and Bailey struggles with letting Alex know she's in town vs. slowly developing feelings for Porter.The chemistry between Bailey and Porter was so sweet and swoon-worthy. I couldn't get enough of the two of them and was silently rooting them on. It was a refreshing, fun read and I was sad to finish it so quickly. It's definitely one of those books for me that sticks with me. \",\n",

And i liked the fact that Bennett didn't shush the sex but still didn't make it too cringy.

Just wow, but that just knocked it down for me. But that\\'s personal opinion. Honestly, it was juvenile the way he acted and they are supposed to be juvenile, so it is kind of realistic, but I just think it\\'s too stupid for me to like haha.Also!

Like there was a decent amount of trauma and background for the different characters that felt... really superficial. Also some storylines felt superfluous and unresolved. (view spoiler)[i.e. Davy and the missing mom. I was pretty disturbed by the lack of communication from the mom completely. (hide spoiler)] Learning that Jenn Bennet has a background as a romance writer explains A LOT about how I felt about the plot and background though. I did really like how there was an emphasis on different cultures, such as Porter was Hawaiian and Grace was Nigerian (Grace was also tragically underused and underdeveloped.) The movie obsession was cute, but it also made me laugh because the characters felt so genuinely like teenagers in that moment. Like they talk about a lot of really famous movies, yet Bailey and Porter seemed surprised the other knew the films. I think I was a bit hesitant because You've Got Mail is one of my favorite films and some of the charm of that movie was missing here. About halfway into the book, it really seems like the online flirtation didn't matter anymore, so towards the end when Bailey feels torn didn't quite have the emotional satisfaction I could've hoped for. (The story behind her nickname was very cute). Also by making Bailey's family paranoid of using social media and thus her reason for the ~secrecy~ of talking to a strange online kind of felt like a cop out instead of finding a way to adapt the You've Got Mail storyline into a modern setting.\",\n",

I have read books with similar books, with similar plotlines, where the writing quality was lower than this one, yet I just didn\\'t love this one. It\\'s not a bad book, by any means. The female lead isn\\'t perfect or overly \"adorkable.\" She had flaws, and a wide range of interests that seem natural instead of an author trying to give a character dimension. The love interest has multiple jobs, a personality, and seems well matched. There were no points where I wanted to shake my head and wonder why the author was forcing something that wasn\\'t working. I just didn\\'t overly care what happened. When you read cute stories meant to be read at a beach, there are two rules: Don\\'t drag it out, and make it addictive. I just read it because it wasn\\'t bad enough to make it an DNF, but I was sort of disappointed. That said, the movie quotes were fun, and the supporting characters meant something to the plot. The love triangle wasn\\'t overplayed, and the relationships with the parents were fun and the author did a good job of giving the leads home lives, grounding some of the antics. ',\n",

Yes it's cute and the romance is good and it's funny, it does right everything a YA has to do right and that alone means I was going to like it.

       " 'This review reveals what some might think of as a spoiler as to the offline identity of \"Alex\", but really, a blind person could tell who that is!Up until Porter found out Baileyâ\\x80\\x99s online identity, I really didnâ\\x80\\x99t have any strong feelings about our â\\x80\\x9cheroâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x93 I neither thought he was a great Book Boyfriend, nor did I think he was unworthy of being the main male character. However, that all changed after The Reveal. Then, I thought he was an utter a**hat, a real hypocrite with all his fine talk about truth and honesty, and then essentially treats Bailey like something that needs to be scraped off the bottom of his shoe.When he realizes that Bailey never â\\x80\\x9cplayedâ\\x80\\x9d him or his online persona of Alex, then he relents and magnanimously deigns to talk to her, but even then, he offhandedly portrays blowing her off as some misunderstanding, rather than tell her the truth. To her credit, Bailey doesnâ\\x80\\x99t immediately relent; she is rightfully still hurt and confused and wonâ\\x80\\x99t do the kiss and makeup that Porter wants until she gets some answers. Good on her!But, as to that, Bailey has fairly consistently shown backbone throughout the novel, beginning with tackling the would-be Maltese Falcon thieves, all the way to her epic meltdown in the HotBox. Thus, I felt the author did a disservice to the character by labeling her the Artful Dodger time and again in the book. We readers see very little of that.Frankly, I thought the novel should have dealt a lot more with Baileyâ\\x80\\x99s PTSD concerning the incident with Greg. One gets the sense that even with all the therapy she underwent, there were still unresolved issues and feelings stemming from The Incident. And a major part of the unresolved issue involves Baileyâ\\x80\\x99s mom. Itâ\\x80\\x99s so unreal that her mom basically chose not to contact Bailey all summer! Yes, so they never had an exceptionally close mother-daughter bond in the first place, but the mom character comes across as a narcissistic, unfeeling, person â\\x80\\x93 someone who was the true Artful Dodger of the story. The pace of the story was slow. Because the story was fairly unoriginal (itâ\\x80\\x99s basically â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99ve Got Mailâ\\x80\\x9d but set in the YA milieu), the characters, pacing and narrative needed to elevate the plot, but alas, that was not to be.I thought Grace, Baileyâ\\x80\\x99s BFF was the best character in this book. She was fun, spunky and heck, who doesnâ\\x80\\x99t love a British accent?As for the best part of the book for me? It was the inclusion of a Star Wars quote. Because of this, â\\x80\\x9cAlex, Approximatelyâ\\x80\\x9d gets a half star bump from me.',\n",

For me, this is what a perfect escapist read is: good writing, good story, minor issues and a tidy little ending. I use these kind of stories for palate cleansers in between heavier books and for days where I donâ\\x80\\x99t want to be disturbed or sad (birthdays, holidays, vacation). So when I read about Alex, Approximately in several review journals, where it received lots of good reviews, I mentally filed it away for a day that I would need it.That day, it turned out, was this past Saturday, during my Birthday weekend. It was a warm and sunny day, one of the few weâ\\x80\\x99ve had this season, and I just wanted to relax on the porch with a book. Alex, Approximately, turned out to be the icing on this relaxing cake of a day. Described as a kind of YA version of You Got Mail, this delightful teenage romp follows 17-year old Bailey â\\x80\\x9cMinkâ\\x80\\x9d Rydell, as she moves across the country to live with her Dad in an idyllic California coastal town. Bailey is a classic movie buff and has made online friends with a fellow movie buff named â\\x80\\x9cAlex,â\\x80\\x9d who also happens to live in this idyllic coastal town. Unsure whether she is ready to tell this online person that she has moved close by, the guarded and (literally, it turns out) gunshy Bailey decides to scope him out in person before revealing herself as his online friend. He could be a creep for all she knows! As you can imagine, hijinx ensue as Bailey quickly falls for her cocky, handsome surfer boy coworker. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll let you fill in the Youâ\\x80\\x99ve Got Mail parallels for yourself.I fully expected the usual romantic comedy plot line of meet cute, misunderstanding/breakup, resolution/reunion. While some of the usual tropes exist in this sweet story, it features an edge and a depth that I didnâ\\x80\\x99t expect. Both Bailey and her love interest have a traumatic experience in their past that keeps them from being completely straight forward with each other and others. And a troubled local teen with a serious drug problem frequently shows up to bring real menace to their otherwise idyllic life. Still, Bennett has written an entirely pleasurable story that will keep you interested, invested and most importantly, distracted. I was sad to see it end!Prescribed for: Anyone in need of a sweet pick-me-up of a story who doesnâ\\x80\\x99t mind teen drama and perspectives. And all YA fans.',\n",

Alex urges her to come to California, where Baileyâ\\x80\\x99s father lives, so they can meet and attend a film festival. Complications arise when she does in fact move to live with her father and doesnâ\\x80\\x99t tell her online friend who lives in the same town. Instead, she tries to figure out who he might be, while beginning to meet and make new friends. One particular boy, Porter, aggravates her but sheâ\\x80\\x99s forced to work with him. As Porter becomes more than an irritant, she wonders if sheâ\\x80\\x99s being untrue to her friend Alex. There isnâ\\x80\\x99t much of a surprise to this romance since the summary gives it away, but Bailey and Porter are a cute couple. The characters are likeable and relatable. Itâ\\x80\\x99s not surprising that Bailey is almost afraid to meet her good friend Alex. He seems perfect online but his reality may be less impressive. Their online relationship is sweet and supportive and she fears a face-to-face meeting might ruin that. But then Porter is delicious in the flesh and tempts her in new ways. This romantic story of secrets, opening up and taking chances is sure to win the hearts of readers. 3.5*',\n",

SO many of the lines were cringe-y and it's as if the author was talking to a child as opposed to the book's intended audience. I also wish there was more drama when she found out who Alex was, because that part was really anti-climactic. I found Bailey very creepy and territorial at times, particularly with Alex which is strange considering they never met and never really discussed their romantic relationship (of lack thereof). However, I really liked that they were ultimate film-nerds which I had never encountered in a book before. I also liked that there were lines from films at the beginning of each chapter hehehe.

Bailey\\'s whole attitude toward Porter in the beginning made me skim through the first few chapters because she hates him with so little justification.

First of all, it\\'s ridiculous that Bailey is this dense about P = A, to the extent that she never even considers Porter to be a candidate for Alex. That\\'s a big plot hole IMO.

No longer is it the AOL tones of  You\\'ve Got Mail , now it\\'s private chat messages through a Film Website.We have Bailey & Porter, who are some of the most real characters that also fit my beauitul YGM story. Bailey is so real, between her anxiety & \"Artful Dodger\" side/wall that she knows she retreats behind. She has such a great character arc throughout the story that you just love it.Her anxiety is believable as are her walls and her slowly letting them down for Grace & Porter.Porter is everything you want in a sassy but caring Main Beau.

Besides of course making me laugh my ass off.So, dear (few yet very lovely) Goodreads friends, I give you 'Alex, approximately'. A story about two teenagers who have been hurt (dreadfully I might add) along with their families and their friends. A story about love in the most unlikely places (seriously creepy museum). A story where you will laugh and cry and be giddy and stop every couple of chapters just because you want to drag the story out for as long as you can hold out! I give you one of my top ten books of the year! I'm pretty sure Jenn Bennett is a witch or something. She has to have done witchcraft (possibly...maybe? whatever. not the point, leila, gawd.) All the characters were carefully crafted in such a way that within the span of a couple of pages not only are you hooked, but you fall in love with them. I fell in love with Bailey and her struggles and her strength and wit. I fell in love with Porter and his ridiculously sexy charm and nerdiness. I fell in love with the families and friends! I fell in love with this amazing tiny town in Northern California (if I am ever in the area I am SOOO tracking this place down). You'll see. Trust me. Also, can Bailey and Grace be my best friends? And can I please find myself a Porter? I wouldn't ever even dream of trying to steal him from Bailey. BLASPHEMY.THE END\",\n",

And while it might be seen as romantic to make someone guess a big secret, it is not romantic to make someone pass an undefined and un-agreed-upon test in order to win your love. So, yeah, the book was cute. The spark between the main characters was strong. But this relationship had major problems in my eyes, and I was left feeling more frustrated than happy at the ending.',\n",

Although the probability of meeting an online friend on the other side of the country and unexpectedly falling with him is so unrealistic, but intriguing and sweet! Mink and Alex are lovable and their personalities compliment each other, even though Bailey and Porter did not have a great start. I love that their love of film made them closer to each other online, but in the end the person they are blossoming to when they are with each other is the main reason they are really meant to be with each other.Friendship, family, love, being in a journey with someone overcoming life's challenges and who is blossoming into a brighter and bolder person, what more can you ask for? ;)PS.

She did not seem like a cliche and fitted right into the book. Porter is great, and somehow really complex. Throughout the book we discover so many new sides of him.

The plot has a believable amount of drama and intrigue, but most importantly, the romance was convincing.

All the yes.Okay, deep breath, back from the start.I\\'m not a big star-giver when it comes to contemporary romance, because I feel like even if I enjoyed it, it won\\'t have a huge impact on me. But this one, ohmy, it was so good and important.The clichÃ©s were few and some tropes were used but in a very subtle way. Even though I saw some scenes coming, it was always smart and surprising, and a nice \"You\\'Ve Got Mail\" YA \"retelling\". Maybe the characters lacked in depth a little (specially since I felt that some descriptions were unnecessary and the main character POV was a bit repetitive at times) but it didn\\'t bother that much because CUTENESS OVERCOMES EVERYTHING. But in all seriousness, I loved that the characters felt so right and that they had some commonsense (GOD BLESS). I also really enjoyed that some serious themes were brought up and handled in a realistic way.But what I loved most was the overall positive writing. Yes, there is some teen drama, and you know what ? The grown-ups figures get involved! Because yes they should. In YA the parents/teachers are too often seen like ennemies, when really, yes, you should ask for their advice. And yes, the characters should call the police when they have to because DUH !And let me tell you about the positive body image! Once again, in YA, sex is often an issue, like it\\'s a forbidden or a dangerous thing, when IRL sex can be such an important part of our lives. So yes, YA authors should talk about positive sex, they should tell teens that sex can be a positive experience, that you don\\'t have to be ashamed of your or your partner\\'s naked body ! Needing and wanting is normal, it\\'s okay, and HUMAN BODS ARE BEAUTIFUL BABY. So, um, anyway.All these little things were really important to me and I had a great time reading this. I\\'ll definitely check out Jenn Bennett\\'s other books!I would strongly recommend for romance lovers, shippers of ship, love avoiders, relationships pessimists and film nerds !',\n",

Porter is the type of guy that drives us crazy. He is obnoxious, rude and seems to be everywhere that Bailey doesnâ\\x80\\x99t want him to be. The more time that Bailey spends with Porter at work, she realizes that there is more to him then meets the eye and they both bear the scars of a tragic experience. I liked Porter because he was someone who was very protective of the people that he cared about and he was someone who was very special, if people took the time to actually get to know him. I figured out his true identity in the beginning of this story and I was very glad that we got to know Porter just like Bailey did.I also liked Bailey from the very beginning. She was shy but sweet and sassy and she was hoping that moving would help break out of her shell. Over the course of the story she learns that when she takes a chance on life instead of hiding she finds that remarkable things can happen.Ms. Bennett has been one of my favorite writers for a very long time and I loved Alex, Approximately.

It should be noted that the setting is more interesting than the characters and their stories: a lavish mansion turned museum built atop a network of caves wherein a married couple found a cache of hidden treasure (from whence it came is never disclosed), which started years of high life that ultimately lead to their grisly demise in a bitter murder-suicide. Alex, Approximately is amiable enough, but I want to read that book.\",\n",
       " \"Don't get me wrong, Alex, Approximately is quite good but the reason for my 3 star rating is more to do with the fact that I expected a bit more. You see, when I read that it's pretty much You've Got Mail with teenagers, I was like, yes, gimmie! But though the plot was very close t one of my favourite 90's rom-coms, the vibe and feel of it didn't come close.Now, the main problem I have with the book is the fact that I didn't find feel the characters and Bailey, our main protagonist, wasn't believable enough. Like, she describes herself as someone who is a master of avoiding conflict, and people in general, but she doesn't feel like someone who is closed up. I would understand if she was closed up to everyone else and our other main character Porter is the only one who brings her out of her shell, but she is open to everyone. And it's a bit contradicting to what she tries to say about herself, which annoyed me.Porter (and don't start with me with the fact that both main characters have drink-related names because both names are pretty rare to begin with and having two of them in the same book.. feels a bit pretentious) is nice though. I liked the sort of bad boy facade which wasn't overly done, but there were moments where I would have liked more explanation and resolve in regards to his certain personality traits. Like, given Bailey's back story, I would have had different reactions to certain aspects of the plot.All in all, it is a very You've Got Mail situation but part of me that liked the movie, felt like the book didn't capture the essence of the movie. And a certain aspect, that I can't reveal because of spoilers, was missing from the book, which is fine, because not every story has to be the same, but I sort of wanted that to happen..

This book was a light read and totally adorable, but I kept thinking, \"Man, I would have LOVED this book in high school!\" I think I might always think this way whenever I read a YA contemporary though...Bailey aka \"Mink\" lives on the East Coast of the U.S. with her mother. She joins an online movie group and keeps in touch (and kind of crushes on) a boy on the West Coast named \"Alex.\" Bailey\\'s mother and boyfriend start fighting too much for Bailey\\'s liking so she decides to move in with her father on the West Coast to evade the situation. She ends up living in the same town as Alex but wants to do some investigating of her own to make sure Alex is who he says he is. Along the way Bailey gets a summer job at a museum where she meets new friends and her new \"arch nemesis,\" Porter. Little does she know, Porter is actually Alex. I love Bailey. She is a geeky, awkward, and introverted \"evader.\" During the whole story, instead of asking for more personal information from Alex, she evades any sort of confrontation by trying to find out who Alex is in real life on her own. I DID roll my eyes whenever she mentioned this, and I DID get annoyed when obvious clues that pointed to Alex being Porter came up. But I feel like this was part of her character. She also has a back story which may explain why she likes to avoid things. I also adored Porter. He\\'s a witty security guard and surfer who gets along with his family yet seems to have a bit of a temper when he is not happy with someone. I also liked that this book was set mostly near a boardwalk and a museum in California. I kind of pictured this being at the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk because of the mention of the redwood trees. California churros definitely taste as good as Bailey makes them out to be!I guess because this book is a romance, Bailey and Alex were the only characters who were fully developed. I would have liked to know more about Bailey\\'s mother, Porter\\'s father, Grace, and Davy. Especially Davy. He is Porter\\'s former/friend who is all kinds of messed up with parents who don\\'t seem to care. I\\'m being picky but because I\\'m from California, the geography confused me! Sometimes I would think they lived in Northern California, but Coronado is in Southern California. The redwoods are also near the Santa Cruz Boardwalk (which is why I kept picturing this happening at the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk) while the Sequoias are more in the SoCal area. Big Sur is also way up in NorCal. I also don\\'t think it\\'s possible to just spend a day in San Francisco when you live in Coronado, but they could have left in the morning I suppose.

She meets a boy nicknamed 'Alex' online on a movie forum and they share a lot of things in common. Alex wants her to travel to California because they are going to have this big movie festival during summer and there is a movie he wants her to see, plus because they click so much, he wants to meet her. When her mother's relationship ends up on the rocks with her current husband, Bailey feels like she has had enough drama and moves to California to live with her dad.It just happens that Alex, also lives in the same city as her dad.Bailey get's cold feet and never tells 'Alex' that she is in town in hopes of scoping out the boy first, in case he is a creepy old man, and with her past she has every right to be careful.Unfortunately the search for Alex hits home a lot closer than she thinks.Can I just say I absolutely loved and adored this book. As far as romances go, this is like one of my top five favorites of this year so far. I had so much fun with this, with Bailey and Porter. I adored them.When the two first meet at work, it's a bit rocky. Porter comes off like an ass and Bailey does not want to cower in front of him.In fact, right from the start he really pisses her off. The two end up arguing a lot, but when they don't fight, sparks fly and magic happens. It turns out, Porter actually really likes her.I just loved this I really did. I needed something light after reading a dark book and this helped a lot. Lately I've also been enjoying Young Adult Contemporary because I haven't read a lot of them. Plus, it helps with the Adult Romance rot I am currently feeling.Bailey and Porter were great together. Not only did I love their relationship. I enjoyed the positive family relationships as well as friendships that developed in this book.I absolutely adored how everything unfolded and that Porter is actually Alex and how the two clicked offline, without actually knowing who the two really are. (This is not a spoiler, it's in the blurb y'all)There wasn't much that I disliked about this book except for the part where Bailey felt a bit thick when it came to the big reveal. Porter kind of put the two and two together first and his reaction made me a bit grumpy, but I just couldn't understand how Bailey did not see the missing puzzle piece when everything was sitting in front of her. Honestly, she should have put the two together a lot more quickly.Also, the Davy storyline in this was a little rough and a bit weirdly unnecessary.Overall, this was a great read - currently top 5 romance favorites this year. It was well written, with a wonderful storyline, great characters, positive relationships with friends, family and between Bailey and Porter.I loved Porter, I really did.

It proclaimed this book to be a YA with witty banter. What immediately came to mind is this book might be like \"The Statistical Probability of Love at First Sight\" by Jennifer E. Smith. I adored that book... and have been looking for something similar to it ever since. I haven\\'t found what I was looking for... even in other books by Smith. However, \"Alex, Approximately\" met and exceeded my expectations of finding something similar to Statistical Probability. I loved the setting of Alex, Approximately. I loved how complex the characters were. I loved how Bailey is an introvert, acknowledging her behavior and the struggle of trying to change. And I love how Porter is a typical, mouthy adolescent idiot with struggles of his own. And I love being a reader and in on the secret from the very beginning and watching as the characters finally get a clue!

       " 'My name is Bailey Rydell, and I\\'m a habitual evader.Readers, whatever you do. Do not go all Artful Dodger on this book the way Bailey goes about in real life. Do not avoid this book. You need to read this book. You will love this book. I swear, every time I have any interaction whatsoever with Porter Roth, something always goes screwy. He\\'s an electrical outlet, and I\\'m the stupid toddler, always trying to poke around and stick my finger inside.There are so many movie references in ALEX, APPROXIMATELY that I don\\'t know where to start. But the easiest way to describe this book is basically the bare bones concept of You\\'ve Got Mail but for teens. Except it goes a little something like this : boy meets girl on film festival forum. Boy and girl talk online for months. Boy wants girl to come out to California and see a movie with him -- and, I mean, also visit her father who happens to live in the same town. Girl has avoidance issues and refuses to commit, also because of reasons. Girl decides to make an educated decision about boy without telling him and flies to California for the summer and try and track him down without him knowing. The hunt doesn\\'t go well. And then there\\'s also Porter.Being with Porter is crazy and exciting. And much like a great thriller film, I\\'m not sure who\\'s going to end up dead by the closing credits.Bailey, as stated in her own words, likes to avoid messy and awkward and potentially damaging and/or hurtful situations. She\\'s shy on the onset and generally prefers to avoid confrontations in any way possible. And can I just say how much I loved this girl. I loved her baggage, even though it broke my heart and was so real and man Bennett did a great job making this a thing without making it a thing, but I loved her growth more. I loved how she evolves, not only because of a boy, but because of a wonderful female-friendship (no catty ladies here!) and also for herself. Maybe Walt Whitman was right. We all really do contradict ourselves and contain multitudes.And then there\\'s Porter. I don\\'t think I have words for what this boy is. Other than brilliant and hilarious and snarky and hardcore and sweet and brilliant and wonderful and arg. \"You might want to look away if you\\'re sensitive to dynamite male bodies. I don\\'t want you swooning at the sight of raw surfer.\"Oh, and cocky. He\\'s that, too.\"You always go around sticking your hands down boys\\' clothes?\"\"When they\\'re full of baked goods.\"\"Tomorrow I\\'m coming to work with ten pounds of pastries in my pants.\"The hate-to-love trope isn\\'t getting old anytime soon but the bonus to this relationship is it actually seemed a little more enemies-to-friends-who-want-to-bang. Which reminds me. I would like to award the author a hundred points to Griffindor for all the sex positivity in this book. There\\'s nothing explicit or graphic in this book, as befitting as YA novel, but.. oh my god, there\\'s one moment between them, after the bonfire.. it\\'s not kissing, it\\'s not a hug, but considering it\\'s a whole lot of nothing it didn\\'t feel like a whole lot of nothing. Whew. Things were much simpler when we were archenemies.This book isn\\'t all movie quotes, mistaken identities, hidden identities, and churros, though. There\\'s some serious events, some violence, heavy tragic moments, uncertain moments, friendships and relationships that are real and messy and painful and awkward, and yet it all blends so wonderfully. ALEX, APPROXIMATELY might not be blow you out of the water amazing, or maybe it will blow you away, who is to say -- in my case I couldn\\'t pull myself away from this book even for a minute, to the point where I missed dinner and made the executive decision that I can live off words instead of food. But anyway : it\\'s the best kind of feel good, with brilliant and diverse and interesting characters that aren\\'t trying too hard to be those things, and that counts for so much.My only complaint is : what the hell is up with the cover? Doesn\\'t fit the vibe for me at all. I\\'ll be buying the UK edition, thanks. 4.75 \"nothing hurts when you\\'re touching me\" stars',\n",
       " \"OH MY GOD THIS BOOK WAS FANTASTIC!!I've been in a major reading slump recently (as you might see, because I am reading three books at the moment, but am not progressing with them at all), and I read this in less than a day.Porter, please give me a Porter. Bailey, I also liked her a lot. I loved her fashion sense, and her love for the older movies. If you know me, you know I also love the style from the 50s, 60s and such. Though I did have a major complaint about both characters. WHY ARE THEY SO OBLIVIOUS. I thought that Porter knew, let me just say that. So his freakout completely caught me off guard. But then again, its way easier to be oblivious to things in real life (I would know), compared to reading or watching something. This book just made me wish I have a similar story in my life, because this was just perfect. I was internally squealing for most of this book, because the story was just so good. I did kinda wish at some points there would be a break up, cause we all know how I much I love pain. Unfortunately there wasn't really, but still loved this book regardless.Recommend to all contemporary/romance lovers!\",\n",
       " 'This was such a fun cute YA contemporary. It is an adaptation of sorts to the movie \"You\\'ve Got Mail\" so it\\'s all about mistaken identities and secrets, and the romance is just so fun to witness. I really enjoyed this book.',\n",
       " \"This is a very good light reading for summer!!Full reviewI dont know if the summary is suppose to spoil you or not. Although I can figure out how will the story turns out even before finished reading the summary..but the summary REALLY will spoil you if you have never read this kind of story before. And I regret myself after reading the whole summary of the book. So, I suggest dear people for not reading the summary.Briefly, this story is about Bailey , a film buff who has been messaging with an online friend ( Alex ) in California. Bailey then moves to California without telling Alex and trying to seek him there.But then, she also encounters Roth, who works at the same place as Bailey. Yeah..you can fill in the details.This reminds me a lot like Geekerella. It pretty much has the same plot , the same start of relationship. But, I can say that this book has better and realistic romance development/pace than geekerella. It makes me giggle and punching my pillows like a mad woman. I love both the mcs, and how their smart-ass comments live-up their relationship. I can truly feel and enjoy how both of them start to have feelings and sometimes , I even find myself getting nervous and my heart thumping like crazy. So, just saying that I really feel connected to the characters.Another thing that I like about this book is , there's no complicated confllict that mess up with my mind. I don't have to feel burden or worried about it, which is okay for me because I'm not in the mood for family conflict or anything. Sometimes, I just feel family conflict is annoying ..because members of family should tolerate to each other and dont give your shits to each others, is what I think. My suggestion is, if you are close and might have problems, try to settle down with your family nicely ( idk, never got in this situation ), and if you arent close, probably you are not really open up with them, so, just keep it to yourself and don't mess up with other family members ( this is what I do ). I mean..lol I dont know..this is what I thought, Im not a family therapist or something.And where are we again? oh. you must be wondering as why this is a 3 stars rating. I have a problem towards the ending where I find the hero is being such an ass. I kinda feel like he is being someone else or something. Or am I the only one who think like this? So, yeah..Alex, approximately is a cool story. I really like it. I recommend it to those who would like to read something light for summer reading. \",\n",

It isn't as lighthearted as I thought it would be, though I wouldn't necessarily call it heavy material. It was cute and fluffy, but still had enough depth to keep me interested.I'm impressed.\",\n",
       " 'This book grabbed my attention from the very beginning, which is definitely a key point for me, it\\'s just unfortunate that the ending kinda lost me a little. It wasn\\'t bad or disappointing per say, but it was all over the place and very rushed. For a story that deals with such an important build up I would have liked a more satisfying reveal, and less background drama that made it seem like we were losing our / Bailey and Porter\\'s time until the timing was dramatic enough. The setting was really fun, I loved the secondary characters, Grace especially, with whom Bailey shared a very genuine friendship. Bailey herself was quite relatable, at least for me, with her tendency to avoid confrontation and her difficulty to trust. I did enjoy her relationship with Porter by itself, I think the correspondent thing in this case just didn\\'t add anything to the story. We barely saw Alex and Mink interact, and when they did it was nothing of true sustenance / it didn\\'t contribute to their relationship. For a book setting its plot around their online connection, that aspect of the story felt kind of underdeveloped.But hey, it\\'s a ya contemporary, it\\'s fluffy in all the right places, and it holds a+ swoon worthy lines. So all in all this book did its job well enough.\\n\"So... do you want it? People might talk.\" I snatch it up with a grin. \"Maybe they\\'ll say that you\\'re mine.\"\"Bailey, I\\'ve been yours.

Everything gets much more complicated when she meets Porter a boy who is actually present and makes her feel things. This is definitely a fluffy read but it was a good fluffy read. Porter and Bailey were adorable and their flirting definitely had sizzle.

       " '\\nActual rating:\\n 2.5/5 stars rounded up to three.I\\'m not a fan of YA Contemporary books (YA Fantasy, on the other hand, is another story) but I didn\\'t think twice about picking up this book because I heard it was inspired by the movies - \"You\\'ve Got Mail\" and \"Shop Around the Corner.\" I\\'ve enjoyed both movies, not just for the unique concept (two people who know each other both online and in real life without realizing it -- however, in one relationship: they are close confidants, and in the other: they are arch-nemesis/rivals of a sort), but I also love the direction the movies took with that idea. I wish I\\'d known that this book is apparently very \"loosely\" inspired by the movies. And that the execution of the premise is a completely different take compared to the movies -- but somewhat standard compared to every other contemporary romance and RomCom. \\nPlot Summary:\\n Our MC, Bailey Rydell, moves to California to live with her father - to avoid the tension of living with her mother and her boyfriend. But moving there also means being in the same place as her online friend, \"Alex\": who knows her as \"Mink\", shares her love for movies but also is someone who is growing to be a close friend - or even more than a friend. But upon arriving, she gets a job at a museum and gets off on the wrong foot with a co-worker, Porter Roth. That relationship between them starts with that heated tension and eventually develops into something deeper as they get to know each other. But the thing is: Alex and Porter are the same guy. And neither Bailey nor Porter know that the other person is the one they\\'ve been talking to online for months. Now, did the book live up to all my expectations of fun and ironic situations that premise can offer?\\nThe Good:\\n Two wonderfully flawed characters, each with their own complexities and past issues, that form a close bond that is very well developed and written. So yes, I liked that Bailey had avoidance issues and had to work on herself to better her friendships/relationships - she\\'s very relatable and mature. And I loved her passion for classic films and movies in general - I was the same when I was a teenager. And Porter, with his ups and downs was also an interesting, fun, and multi-faceted character. \\n\\nMaybe Walt Whitman was right. We all really do contradict ourselves and contain multitudes. How do we even figure out who we really are?\\n\\nThey were both very likable characters with a well written romance. I loved how they could disagree but still get along - there was a lot to appreciate about the characters and their relationship.\\nThe Not-so-good:\\n To be honest, throughout most of the book, I was bored. I spent so long trying to get into it -- two weeks, I think -- but it just wasn\\'t what I was looking for. Here why:* I felt kind of cheated. That\\'s my fault for having expectations and comparing the book to the movies. The whole \"Alex\" issue/mystery quickly fades into the background. Not just that - I mean the online part of their relationship is barely existent, or rather we\\'re shown so very little of it. It doesn\\'t really offset or play into the characters\\' real one - it\\'s more a part of their past than the present. So, really, the whole concept of obliviously knowing one other as two different people - that irony or even the mystery of it - is barely explored. It\\'s not as relevant to the main plot as I thought it would be. * And even putting the Alex/Mink part of the story aside - Porter and Bailey lose that fire and conflict between them too quickly. I expected the tension and heated banter to last a bit longer. They were each other\\'s \"arch-nemesis\" for like 20% of the book and then they were starting to get along and the getting-to-know-you romance started happening. It was... well developed and (there was still strong chemistry and even banter - but the cute type) and all that -- but nothing special to keep me wondering or even caring enough. I wanted more of this:\\n\\nHe holds out the receiver to me. â\\x80\\x9cGo on, say something, superstar.â\\x80\\x9d I shake my head. Not happening. I donâ\\x80\\x99t like the spotlight. Now Iâ\\x80\\x99m regretting that I asked about the yellow button. He tries to coax me into taking it with that laid-back voice of his, but his eyes are 100 percent challenge, like this is some sort of contest, and heâ\\x80\\x99s trying to see whoâ\\x80\\x99ll break first. â\\x80\\x9cCome on. Donâ\\x80\\x99t get shy on me now, glamour girl.â\\x80\\x9d Again with the catty nicknames? What is his problem? Well, he can forget it. Now itâ\\x80\\x99s a matter of principle. I cross my arms over my chest. â\\x80\\x9cNo.â\\x80\\x9d \"Itâ\\x80\\x99s just a little-bitty intercom,â\\x80\\x9d he says, wiggling the receiver in front of me. I shove his hand away. Okay, maybe I kind of slap it away. But Iâ\\x80\\x99ve just about had it with him. Iâ\\x80\\x99m genuinely irritated.\\n\\nPaired up against:\\n@alex: Tell me about your terrible, no-good, really bad day. Does your boss suck? @mink: Eh. Too soon to tell. I got stuck with the crap assignment and one of my coworkers is a colossal dickbag. Heâ\\x80\\x99s going to make my life miserable. I can already tell. @alex: Make him miserable right back. You are Mink! Hear you roar! @mink: *cough* *sputter* *broken meow* @alex: Chin up. Youâ\\x80\\x99ll best this loser. Boys are dumb.\\nThe book was great at the start with moments like that but then the plot shifted mainly to Porter and Bailey\\'s growing relationship (date one, date two, misadventures and life occurences, special moments here and there...)... I started getting restless for something to happen at some point. I kept wondering when the \"Alex\" twist would come back and put a spark back in the book! ((It did but late enough that I stopped caring - and the way it happened made me lose even more interest)).* But wait, let\\'s not forget we have an antagonist in the story for that; Porter\\'s ex-best friend, Davey - who has a bad drug addiction and criminal record, and who once went behind Porter\\'s back with an ex-girlfriend, and now has his mind set on harassing Porter and Bailey... I mean... Was that needed? The original plot/twist would be interesting enough if it was used more prominently - it wouldn\\'t have needed a Davey to shake things up for Porter and Bailey!And I understand that the author meant to show that knowing a person for all they are needs getting to know each other deeply and personally - learning all sides to a person. But if that\\'s the message of the book then it made for a good depiction of a well developed romantic relationship - using the online/offline concept in the background to further its point. But if you\\'re looking for a fun romantic story that takes this concept (of dual identities) and cleverly plays with the possibilities it presents (like I was hoping for) - then watch \"You\\'ve Got Mail\" or \"Shop Around the Corner\" instead. Because this book is not like those movies in that way. It simply turned out to be a regular Contemporary Romance. But if you like Contemporary Romances - or if you like those but avoid the YA genre - then give this a try, because it\\'s a well-written one with a mature romance and complex characters.I just usually prefer when there\\'s a bit of a twist or something beyond the normal to make the story more compelling. That\\'s why I should stick more to Fantasy, Sci-fi, or even Mysteries, and take another break from contemporaries. So maybe my lack of enthusiasm for this book is more of a \"it\\'s me, not you\" situation.',\n",

Bailey moves to a Californian city to live with her dad, which is coincidentally the same city that her online crush 'Alex' lives in. Throw in the classic 'falling for the last person you'd think of' trope and a lot of mature (not NC-17 but real mature adult stuff), you get Alex Approximately.This book is so much more than just the cheesy high-school romance, but more like a story of healing and trust... and boy I felt like this was too mature for a high-school setting. There was a death, hard drugs, physical trauma, a shooting... Real mature stuff for highschoolers... but somehow it all worked, yenno? Alex, Approximately was written fantastically and the plot was just flawlessly executed. We all knew that the ending was, but the journey was the fun part.

       " \"New. Favourite. Book. It touched on the usual ya elements like family, friendships, and relationships--but it went so much deeper. It's definitely a more mature ya book though, as it discussed topics such as drugs, crime, and sex.I instantly fell in love with everything this book has to offer. The California setting and beach-y town atmosphere was just so easy to visualize and it felt like you were actually there. I really loved the main character, Bailey, because she's so rational and mature, especially in her relationship with Porter (who is a great love interest by the way). Speaking of relationships, I love the hate-to-love relationship in this one. Their chemistry is through the roof and I also liked that they formed a friendship (unknowingly) through a common interest in old films. Something else I really like was that Grace, Bailey's best friend, and Porter, brought some diversity into this novel, specifically their culture and the food they eat. It added a really nice feel to the book and I'm glad Jenn incorporated it. This book was just so addicting and I couldn't put it down. It's become an all time favourite and I see myself rereading this in the near future. This is a must-read summer contemporary! Highly, highly recommend.\",\n",

Bailey is still recovering from a rather dark incident in her past that has given her PTSD. She spends time online with Alex watching classic movies. She begins working at a museum and finds herself dealing with the rather annoying Porter. Then she finds herself falling for him. But he couldn't possibly be Alex, could he?

Bailey has something dark in her past that she has to work through as well.At first I didn\\'t think I\\'d like Porter because he comes across as a bit of a jerk but I know that is because of the \"You\\'ve Got Mail retelling\" aspect of the story. Like Bailey, Porter has his own issues to deal with involving a broken friendship and his complicated relationship with surfing. I liked how his relationship with Bailey develops first online and then in person while they don\\'t know about their online connection. I also liked the other relationships in the book, namely the friendship between Bailey and Grace and the positive relationship between Bailey and her dad.

I liked how the author added little movie quotes at the top of each chapter and it related to the story somehow. I find Bailey relatable because I find myself to be very awkward, and I tend to avoid confrontations, but I'm trying my best to grow out of it! I also liked how it wasn't cliche, and I couldn't guess what was going to happen next but the one thing I knew (the most important detail) literally through the whole book, that Porter is Alex.The turn offs of this book is that the author spoils who Alex is (Porter) in the description, so I couldn't guess and try to find Alex along with Bailey. But even if she didn't include that detail in the description, it was still really obvious it was Porter... I kind of guessed from the beginning, and there was no other character of who it could have been, other than Patrick, but you know what happens haha. I also didn't like how she didn't figure out it was porter - low key drove me crazy, but I feel like if she knew sooner the rest of the book wouldn't be as exciting.Overall I enjoyed this book so much and I 10/10 recommend. I saw other reviews on this book and people said that this book is like a modern version the movie You've got mail. I haven't watched it but I will.

There is drama, there is angst, there is humor, and there is most definitely a hell of a romance. The Romance is the hate to love, slow burn sort. No insta-love bullshit. And they aren't perfect snowflake people either. That's one reason this book works so well. You've got two people that are very clearly flawed and I love that.

This book was just the right one at the right day with the right weather, and it was more than enough for me to obsess over. It was so simple yet it was totally a breath of fresh air.

The book was told perfectly through her voice and thoughts. The issues she\\'s been going through, while being the Artful Dodger she is, was fun to witness. I just loved seeing her develop as a character. Of course, having Porter by her side...well, that\\'s a different story. A story I\\'ve come to love much better.\\nIâ\\x80\\x99m trying-trying-trying not to breathe so fast. But Porter shifts, and the hand that isnâ\\x80\\x99t trapping me falls to the side. His fingers dance over my hand, a gossamer touch, and he traces soft patterns on my open palm, Morse code taps, gently urging, send a thousand electric currents of signals up my nerves.â\\x80\\x9cWhy?â\\x80\\x9d he whispers against my cheek.I whimper.He knows heâ\\x80\\x99s won.

His head drops to the crook of my neck and rests there. The fingers that were teasing me with their little tap-tap-tapping messages now curl around my fingers, loosely clasping. And the arm pinning me to the mailbox is now lifting away, and I feel his hand smooth down the length of my hair.\\n Porter, Porter, Porter. This boy. I swear. There are so many layers with this boy, but it feels like you\\'ll never get tired in discovering each one. Porter was so easy to love. Aggressive at first, but damn if that doesn\\'t just make him more charming than he already is. He was such a sweetheart, and his lowkey intelligence is just outright sexy. I should feel so attacked with his amazingness. I am in awe of Porter.

I loved how he didn\\'t give her an inch and was constantly being playful and all in-her-face. The beginning of their relationship started off with Bailey hating on Porter hardcore, getting annoyed at everything he did... and this just made me love him even more!! Hate-to-love romances are some of my faves, and this was no exception. What a fun relationship these two developed! Swoon overload!!!Aside from the incredible romance, there was so much more to this book to love. The friendship between Bailey and the friend she meets in California, Grace, was so fun to watch evolve. I also fully enjoyed the relationship Bailey had with her father. Though they struggled at times to see eye-to-eye, he was very much involved in her life and they, together, worked out their issues. He was a fantastic father that always had his daughter\\'s back. I loved it! Also worth mentioning was the great bond between Porter and his family. I adored his mother and they way she brought their very busy family together as a team. The support and loyalty the families showed each and every member was very refreshing and a joy to find in a YA book.Let me mention the settings in this book as well, since they\\'re ah-mazing! First, we have a beach setting. I mean, seriously... boardwalks, sunshine, surfing... how can you not love it! When I was a teenager I always dreamed of spending a summer in a place like this. How incredible! Add to that the fun museum setting and WOW! I loved how the museum was completely brought to life, flaws and all. Bailey\\'s having to work in the \"hot box\" and sweat all day, the incredibly old-school security system, the silly-named rooms... Jenn Bennett knows how to make you feel connected to every single person, place and thing in her stories.Welp, Jenn Bennett did it again!!! She completely blew me away with \\nThe Anatomical Shape of a Heart\\n last year, and Jack has been my book boyfriend since I first met him. And guys, here comes Porter, now sitting at the very tippity top of my BBF list right along side him!! â\\x99¥ Relatable characters that are so real they are impossible not to connect with, a romance that\\'s so fun, silly and swoony you\\'ll fall hard, and a storyline that is unputdownable from beginning to end, this is a real gem.

Both Bailey\\'s and Porter\\'s issues with past traumas, and how they deal with life, family, and friends is what added layers to the otherwise pretty predictable plot.As far as protagonist voices go, Bailey\\'s \"Artful Dodger\" evader tendencies and how she grows into facing her issues, is so relatable to anyone who hates dealing with confrontation, negativity, and PTSD.The movie quotes and references for me, as a fellow movie-obsessed person, was what pushed this to a 5-star rating.

I also enjoyed both of their backstories (even though they were super sad, but it made the characters more valuable to me). I loved the character development as well and their relationships with other characters, such as Grace, Porters family, dad and Wanda, sweet Pangborn, and even Davy. I liked how the author added little movie quotes at the top of each chapter and it related to the story somehow. I find Bailey relatable because I find myself to be very awkward, and I tend to avoid confrontations, but I'm trying my best to grow out of it! I also liked how it wasn't cliche, and I couldn't guess what was going to happen next but the one thing I knew (the most important detail) literally through the whole book, that Porter is Alex.The turn offs of this book is that the author spoils who Alex is (Porter) in the description, so I couldn't guess and try to find Alex along with Bailey. But even if she didn't include that detail in the description, it was still really obvious it was Porter... I kind of guessed from the beginning, and there was no other character of who it could have been, other than Patrick, but you know what happens haha. I also didn't like how she didn't figure out it was porter - low key drove me crazy, but I feel like if she knew sooner the rest of the book wouldn't be as exciting.Overall I enjoyed this book so much and I 10/10 recommend. I saw other reviews on this book and people said that this book is like a modern version the movie You've got mail. I haven't watched it but I will. I would love to see this as a movie since it's a unique story and it's something you don't see everyday. But if it does end up being a story, I hope it doesn't ruin it.\",\n",

I often get that feeling in really good books, but after this one ended I said, \"okay, next book.\"I deducted the second star because while I enjoyed the pretense of the book and the storyline of the book, I don\\'t feel the description matches up with the story line. The conversations between Mink and Alex are minimal and don\\'t quite feel like a big portion of the story (i.e. Cindy Ella or Cinder & Ella (wow I have a thing for Cinderella stories) or even P.S. I Like You (there, a non Cinderella one!)). I admit I was disappointed because (as you can tell), I do enjoy a good \"I hate you, but I secretly love your messages so now I love you\" book!Other than that I would say the story is good. Character development is strong and I enjoyed the inner dialogue of Bailey. Would recommend for people in high school, early college (if you\\'re into a little more innocent books)!',\n",

       " \"If you like You've Got Mail, 80s teen movies, and I'll Give You The Sun, this book is essentially written for you. It is also surprisingly good about things like PTSD, victim blaming, sexual harassment - things you don't always expect to be treated well in a romantic comedy. This is a good one.\",\n",

       " \"Can I please give this book a million stars? Because that's what it deserves to me.It's been years since I have actually enjoyed a Contemporary book, especially a YA contemporary. I'm generally a high fantasy kind of girl so when I came across this book the other day as I was killing time waiting on a prescription to be filled, I hesitated to even pick it up. Why waste my money on a book I was sure would be added to the dusty pile of DNF books? But there was just something that pulled me back and good God am I glad I went with that feeling.This book is magic. The story is magic. The characters are familiar and relatable. There is drama, there is angst, there is humor, and there is most definitely a hell of a romance. The Romance is the hate to love, slow burn sort. No insta-love bullshit. And they aren't perfect snowflake people either. That's one reason this book works so well. You've got two people that are very clearly flawed and I love that. I could write a lot more about this but it's one of those books that I think you should just dive into blindly. All I can tell you is that this is one of the best contemporary novels I've read in ages and it has earned a spot on my favorite books ever shelf. Read it, love it, devour it. It's worth every moment you spend on it!!\",\n",

       " 'This book was almost too perfect to a fault. I mean it had everything a good summer read can haveâ\\x80\\x94talks about good taste in movies, gives off a fifties vibe, has eclectic characters working inside a cave museum, and includes surfing dudes who are far too charming and intellectual for their own good. This book was just the right one at the right day with the right weather, and it was more than enough for me to obsess over. It was so simple yet it was totally a breath of fresh air. Alex, Approximately had all the right pieces enough to charm the pants out of me.\\n\"Listen to me, okay? Whatâ\\x80\\x99s between us? This is the best thing thatâ\\x80\\x99s ever happened to me in my entire life, and I donâ\\x80\\x99t want it to end. Sometimes you feel so tricky, like fog over the oceanâ\\x80\\x94like you just showed up at the beginning of the summer, and one day the sun will come out and youâ\\x80\\x99ll disappear and go back to your mom. And that scares the hell out of me. So thatâ\\x80\\x99s why I tell you things about me, because I figure if I weigh you down with my baggage, then youâ\\x80\\x99ll be less likely to run.\"\\n Bailey was such a character! I loved her intelligence, her sense of style, her Lana Turner hair, and even her adorable awkwardness. I seriously want to be friends with her in real life. The book was told perfectly through her voice and thoughts. The issues she\\'s been going through, while being the Artful Dodger she is, was fun to witness. I just loved seeing her develop as a character. Of course, having Porter by her side...well, that\\'s a different story. A story I\\'ve come to love much better.\\nIâ\\x80\\x99m trying-trying-trying not to breathe so fast. But Porter shifts, and the hand that isnâ\\x80\\x99t trapping me falls to the side. His fingers dance over my hand, a gossamer touch, and he traces soft patterns on my open palm, Morse code taps, gently urging, send a thousand electric currents of signals up my nerves.â\\x80\\x9cWhy?â\\x80\\x9d he whispers against my cheek.I whimper.He knows heâ\\x80\\x99s won. But he asks one more time, this time against my ear. â\\x80\\x9cWhy?â\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x9cBecause I wanted to see you.â\\x80\\x9dI canâ\\x80\\x99t even hear my own voice, but I know he does when a sigh gusts out of him, long and hard. His head drops to the crook of my neck and rests there. The fingers that were teasing me with their little tap-tap-tapping messages now curl around my fingers, loosely clasping. And the arm pinning me to the mailbox is now lifting away, and I feel his hand smooth down the length of my hair.\\n Porter, Porter, Porter. This boy. I swear. There are so many layers with this boy, but it feels like you\\'ll never get tired in discovering each one. Porter was so easy to love. Aggressive at first, but damn if that doesn\\'t just make him more charming than he already is. He was such a sweetheart, and his lowkey intelligence is just outright sexy. I should feel so attacked with his amazingness. I am in awe of Porter. What I\\'d do to spend a day with Porter. *sigh* Porter is love, Porter is life, everybody!\\nThe bar comes down, trapping us together. Arm against arm. Leg against leg, flesh against flesh. My heart beats against my rib cage as if itâ\\x80\\x99s excitedly keeping time with a song. Every once in a while, I feel his eyes on my face, but I donâ\\x80\\x99t dare look back. We ride in silence the entire way down, watching the town get bigger and bigger.A couple of yards before we hit the ground, he speaks up in a voice so quiet, I can barely hear him. â\\x80\\x9cWhat I said the other day about you having champagne tastes?â\\x80\\x9d He pauses for a moment. Mr. Reyes is smiling, waiting to unhitch our bar. â\\x80\\x9cI just wanted you to know that I like the way you dress. I like your style. . . . I think itâ\\x80\\x99s sexy as hell.â\\x80\\x9d\\n I also loved how each character didn\\'t feel secondary, like they all played a vital role for me. And Pangborn...I\\'VE NEVER CRIED SO MUCH! I love that old man.This book was just beyond approximation. It was absolutely perfect until the very last page! 5 stars!\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDoes this hurt?â\\x80\\x9d I ask, lightly dabbing antibiotic ointment on his wound. It looks like a crevice in a dry desert, red and angry, cracked open.â\\x80\\x9cNothing hurts when youâ\\x80\\x99re touching me,â\\x80\\x9d he says in a faraway voice.\\n ',\n",

       " 'ALL THE SWOONS!! I\\'m continually wowed by how Jenn Bennett can consistently write the absolute BEST book boyfriends! These guys are so perfectly imperfect, and I adore them!! Porter was an immediate love for me. He was so confident, silly, and aggravatingly sarcastic. I lit up when it came to the banter between him and Bailey. I loved how he didn\\'t give her an inch and was constantly being playful and all in-her-face. The beginning of their relationship started off with Bailey hating on Porter hardcore, getting annoyed at everything he did... and this just made me love him even more!! Hate-to-love romances are some of my faves, and this was no exception. What a fun relationship these two developed! Swoon overload!!!Aside from the incredible romance, there was so much more to this book to love. The friendship between Bailey and the friend she meets in California, Grace, was so fun to watch evolve. I also fully enjoyed the relationship Bailey had with her father. Though they struggled at times to see eye-to-eye, he was very much involved in her life and they, together, worked out their issues. He was a fantastic father that always had his daughter\\'s back. I loved it! Also worth mentioning was the great bond between Porter and his family. I adored his mother and they way she brought their very busy family together as a team. The support and loyalty the families showed each and every member was very refreshing and a joy to find in a YA book.Let me mention the settings in this book as well, since they\\'re ah-mazing! First, we have a beach setting. I mean, seriously... boardwalks, sunshine, surfing... how can you not love it! When I was a teenager I always dreamed of spending a summer in a place like this. How incredible! Add to that the fun museum setting and WOW! I loved how the museum was completely brought to life, flaws and all. Bailey\\'s having to work in the \"hot box\" and sweat all day, the incredibly old-school security system, the silly-named rooms... Jenn Bennett knows how to make you feel connected to every single person, place and thing in her stories.Welp, Jenn Bennett did it again!!! She completely blew me away with \\nThe Anatomical Shape of a Heart\\n last year, and Jack has been my book boyfriend since I first met him. And guys, here comes Porter, now sitting at the very tippity top of my BBF list right along side him!! â\\x99¥ Relatable characters that are so real they are impossible not to connect with, a romance that\\'s so fun, silly and swoony you\\'ll fall hard, and a storyline that is unputdownable from beginning to end, this is a real gem. If you love adorableness, topped with all the swooning, and a side of emotions, this is a must-read for you!\\n(Thanks to Simon Pulse for the review copy!)Find this review and others like it at Lost in Literature!\\n\\n\\n']"
